What is the formula for calculating the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) based on the Last Menstrual Period (LMP)?,"The formula for calculating the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) based on the Last Menstrual Period (LMP) is as follows:

EDD = LMP + 9 months + 7 days

This formula takes into account several factors that influence pregnancy and delivery:
1. The LMP refers to the first day of the woman's last menstrual period.
2. The formula assumes a regular menstrual cycle before conception, which is typically 28-30 days long.
3. The EDD is based on the assumption that the menstrual cycle was regular before conception.

To calculate the actual delivery date, you would need to add 9 months and 7 days to the LMP. This calculation helps in predicting when a woman will be ready for childbirth, ensuring she has enough time to get pregnant and deliver safely.","['VIRAL HEPATITIS\n78 \nRoles of SHC-HWC Team under CHO\nASHA MPW F/M\n1.

Malnutrition:
Nutrition influences growth and development throughout infancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is, 
however, during the period of adolescence that nutrient needs are the greatest. 
Malnutrition can be classified as under-nutrition, over-nutrition (overweight and obesity), and 
micronutrient deficiency. Under-nutrition is when someone is not getting enough calories or nutrients; 
it can be due to either an insufficient diet or a problem in assimilating nutrients. Over-nutrition occurs 
when too many nutrients are ingested. Deficiency of micronutrients such as vitamins, iron, calcium, zinc, 
etc. affects body’s immune system. All types of malnutrition can lead to serious health problems which 
can be fatal.
The signs and symptoms of malnutrition include:
 ● Fatigue and low energy
 ● Problems with learning
 ● Bloated stomach
 ● Slowed reaction times and trouble paying attention

etc. affects body’s immune system. All types of malnutrition can lead to serious health problems which 
can be fatal.
The signs and symptoms of malnutrition include:
 ● Fatigue and low energy
 ● Problems with learning
 ● Bloated stomach
 ● Slowed reaction times and trouble paying attention
 ● Dizziness
 ● Poor immune function (which leads to frequent illnesses in the adolescent)
 ● Dry, scaly skin, swollen and bleeding gums
 ● Decaying teeth
 ● Underweight and poor growth
 ● Muscle weakness and bones that break easily
Management of Nutrition
Nutrition Assessment and Counselling in adolescents 
Nutritional assessment is an important part of evaluation of an adolescent. A stepwise approach should 
be adopted. 
Step 1: History - Nutritional history in adolescence 
History about foods and eating habits should be taken primarily from the adolescent alone, and from 
parents also but separately. This is important as adolescent may not reveal some of the eating behaviours 
in front of the parents. It should be clarified to the adolescent that the purpose is to find out problem 
areas and not to find faults in them. In nutritional history, all details about food pattern, past and present 
illness, daily physical activities should be noted. You can refer RKSK resource book for medical officer for 
detail.

What is Sarcopenia in the context of elderly health?,"Sarcopenia refers to the degenerative loss of muscle mass and strength that occurs with age. It's a common condition associated with older adults, particularly those over 65 years old. This degeneration can be caused by various factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, hormonal changes, or genetic predisposition.

Sarcopenia affects both the elderly population and younger individuals who are approaching their senior years. It is characterized by a gradual loss of muscle mass and strength, which can lead to reduced physical ability and an increased risk of falls and accidents. The severity of sarcopenia varies among individuals; some may experience minimal effects while others may experience significant changes.

Sarcopenia affects not only the elderly but also younger adults who are nearing retirement age. It is a common condition that can affect both genders, though it tends to be more prevalent in women due to hormonal changes associated with menopause and other factors such as sedentary lifestyles.

The causes of sarcopenia include:
1. Poor diet: A diet lacking in essential nutrients like protein, vitamins, and minerals can contribute to muscle loss.
2. Lack of exercise: Regular physical activity is crucial for maintaining muscle mass and strength.
3. Hormonal changes: Changes in hormones such as estrogen and testosterone can affect muscle function.
4. Genetics: Some individuals may be at higher risk due to genetic factors.

Sarcopenia can lead to several consequences:
- Reduced mobility: Older adults often experience difficulty with daily activities, which can increase the risk of falls and accidents.
- Increased risk of falls: The loss of muscle mass and strength makes older adults more susceptible to falling.
- Decreased independence: With reduced physical ability, older individuals may struggle to perform tasks that require strength or endurance.

Sarcopenia is a multifactorial condition that requires comprehensive management. It's important for healthcare providers to identify early signs of sarcopenia in elderly patients and implement interventions such as regular exercise programs, dietary modifications, and medication management. Early detection and treatment can help prevent the progression of sarcopenia and improve quality of life for older adults.

In summary, sarcopenia is a common condition that affects both older adults and younger individuals approaching their senior years. It's characterized by muscle loss due to poor diet, lack of exercise, hormonal changes, or genetic predisposition. Sarcopenia can lead to reduced mobility, increased risk of falls, and decreased independence in older adults.

Declining fertility \nand increase in survival at older ages has resulted in the proportion of older people (60 \nyears and above) in general population increasing substantially within a relatively short \nperiod of time. India recorded a significant improvement in life expectancy at birth, \nwhich was 47 years in 1969, growing to 60 years in 1994 and 69 years in 2019\n1.\nThe share of population of elderly was 8% in 2015 i.e. 106 million (10 crores plus) \nacross the nation, making India the second largest global population of elderly citizens. \nFurther, it has been projected that by 2050 the elderly population will increase to 19%\n2\nii) As the elderly population continues to grow, elderly dependency ratio will rise \ndramatically from 0.12 to 0.31. Gender disparity has also been reported with 50% of \nwomen aged 75 years and older report difficulty with at least one Activity of Daily. Life \n(ADL) compared to only 24% of men, adding the focus towards female elderly care\n3.\niii) Elderly populations have varying and complex social and health-care needs. For \nexample, while dementia maybe addressed with health inputs, the social and financial \ninsecurities that may co-exist require inputs from the social welfare and finance sectors. \nA multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach, comprising professionals and general', '2\na framework to create an enabling environment for “Society for all Ages”.

Primary ageing is the product of interactions between \nintrinsic, genetically determined factors and extrinsic factors in lifestyle and environment.\nBased on the physical capacity to work, the old are placed in three categories:\n o Recent old who are still active and undertake normal activities without support.\n o Old who work with difficulty and hence have reduced activities.\n o Very old who work with difficulty in home or cannot work at all.\nOlder age group categories \nCategory Age Group (years)\nElderly (Older persons) 65+ (sometimes 60+)\nOldest-old 80+\n12.2 Common diseases of Geriatrics\nOrgan System Ailments\nCardiovascular system Myocardial Infarction, Hypertension, Congestive Cardiac Failure.', '198\nOrientation Guidelines for Community Health Officers (CHOs)-Homoeopathy\nOthers Ophthalmic Senile Cataract, Presbyopia (refractive error), Dry eye syndrome, \nGlaucoma, Age related Macular Degeneration (ARMD).\nAuditory Impaired/ Loss of hearing (presbycussis).\nCancer Prostatic Cancer, Lung Cancer, Colon Cancer, Breast Cancer.\nGynecological Pelvic organ prolapse, Malignancies, Dry vagina.\nOthers Dental problems Loss of teeth, inability to chew which are potent cause of \nnutritional deficiencies, gastric problems.\n12.3 General principles of geriatric care\nThe following principles are helpful to keep in mind while caring for older adults:\no Many disorders are multifactorial in origin.\no Diseases often present atypically.\no Not all abnormalities require evaluation and treatment.\no Complex medication regimens, adherence problems, medication dependence, and \npolypharmacy are common challenges.\no Multiple chronic conditions often coexist and should be managed in concert with one \nanother.\nRisk of many malignancies increases with age. Multimorbidities are common and many old \nage persons are on multiple medications. Risk of fall and accidents is greater in old age due \nto joint deformities, lack of balance, multimorbidity conditions and medication use, further \ncompromising old age functioning.\nGeriatric care, therefore, encompasses an estimate of potential risk or mortality and increasing \nmorbidity in the aged person and a holistic treatment approach taking into consideration', 'weight and body mass index (BMI 20–27).

Fig 4: Role of CHO in safe abortion services
• CHO should support the ASHA and MPW of the SHC-HWC to increase awareness in the community regarding 
risks and consequences of adolescent pregnancy, childbirth, and unsafe abortions.
• Provide easily available, friendly, non-judgemental, confidential family planning, counselling, and services.
• Recognition of signs and symptoms of abortion complications (heavy bright red vaginal bleeding with or 
without clots, pallor etc).
• Refer to appropriate referral site for safe abortion services. For medical method of abortion up to 7 weeks refer 
to PHC-MO and to CHC/DH if pregnancy is 8 weeks to 20 weeks.
• With approval of two registered medical practitioners, termination of pregnancies can be done between 20 to 
24 weeks.  The termination of pregnancies up to 24 weeks will only apply to specific categories of women, as 
may be prescribed by the government guidelines.
• Follow up for any post abortion complications and refer to higher facility if needed.
• Provide post abortion contraceptive counselling.

Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)
Due to high-risk sexual behaviour, young generation face the risk of RTIs and STIs like HIV-AIDS. Many 
adolescents engage in sexual intercourse with multiple partners without contraceptives, placing them 
at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections, including herpes genitals, syphilis, gonorrhoea, 
chancroid, genital warts, and HIV.
Consequences of Unsafe Sexual Behaviour among Adolescents
 ● Early pregnancy and parenthood
 ● Higher percentage of Low Birth Weight (LBW) babies and increased infant morbidity and mortality
 ● Abortions and its related complications
 ● RTI/STI including HIV/AIDS
Consequences that are higher in adolescents even if it has been ‘safe sex’
 ● Emotional impact – guilt, stress, anxiety, suicide
 ● Social impact – stigma
 ● Economic impact – hindrance to academic and career progression
RTI is an infection of the genital tract. The infection can affect vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, tubes, and 
ovaries in women. Infection of uterus and the tube, known as Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases (PID), can 
result in infertility. RTIs include all infections of the reproductive tract, whether transmitted sexually or 
not.
STI is transmitted from one person to another primarily by sexual contact. Some STIs can be transmitted 
by exposure to contaminated blood, or from a mother to her unborn child. This is a major public health 
problem for two reasons:

STI is transmitted from one person to another primarily by sexual contact. Some STIs can be transmitted 
by exposure to contaminated blood, or from a mother to her unborn child. This is a major public health 
problem for two reasons:
 ● It is common among adolescents to go to untrained and unskilled providers especially when they 
are unmarried, or if married and the pregnancy is unintended, the adolescent wants to get rid of it 
clandestinely (without informing the in-laws). The younger they are, it is more likely that they will be 
forced to opt for a potentially unsafe abortion conducted in an unhygienic condition by an unskilled 
provider.
 ● There is a general lack of awareness among adolescents about the ‘Medical Termination of Pregnancy’ 
that can be availed at registered health facilities. These are inaccessible because of the family’s need 
for secrecy, confidentiality, and pressure from societal and community demands.
 ● Use of dangerous methods are also common in adolescents, especially unmarried girls who are 
advised by mothers, untrained birth attendants, quacks, to insert foreign bodies (sticks, roots etc.) into 
the cervix un-hygienically or ingest certain potions or drugs.
 ● Even after a spontaneous abortion, an adolescent may have post abortion complications, if the 
abortion is not complete or some infection has occurred or unhygienic practices were followed.",75.95658302307129,3900.8266925811768,10,BM25 (Sparse)

Types of anemia:
1. Nutritional Anemia: It is caused due to deficiency of micro-nutrient such as minerals (iron, zinc, 
copper, selenium etc.) and vitamins (Folic acid, Vit B12, Vit B6)
2. Non-nutritional Anemia:  Due to hemoglobinopathies (thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), Soil 
Transmitted helminths inflammation, fluorosis and malaria and diseases such as tuberculosis etc.
Nutritional Anemia:
In nutritional anemia, due to the decrease in haemoglobin level below normal (Hb less than 12gm %), 
every tissue cell suffers from lack of oxygen.  Grading of anemia as per WHO is as mentioned in Table 8
Table 8: Grading of anemia
Population Anemia
Mild Moderate Severe
Adolescent girls 10-19 years  10.0-11.9 gm/dl 7-9.9 gm/dl <7gm/dl
Adolescent boys 10-19 years 12-12.9 gm/dl 9.0-11.9 gm/dl < 9 gm/dl
The cause, signs, and symptoms of nutritional anemia is as under
Table 9: Causes, sign and symptoms of Nutritional Anemia
Causes Signs and symptoms
• Inadequate intake of the dietary iron.
• Improper absorption of iron.
• Loss of iron from the body.
• Worm infestations.
• Tiredness and weakness.
• Breathlessness.
• Pale face, nails, tongue, and conjunctiva of eyes.
• Lack of concentration:
  Reduces capacity to work thus decreased productivity.
  Limit learning ability.
  Causes loss of appetite.
  Affects the growth and development.

  Limit learning ability.
  Causes loss of appetite.
  Affects the growth and development.
  Increases vulnerability to infections due to decrease in 
immunity.
Anemia in girls has deleterious consequences. Anemic girls on entering the reproductive age, will have 
lower pre-pregnancy iron stores and are at an increased risk of giving birth to pre-term newborns, babies 
with a low birth weight (below 2,500 grams) and have complications during child birth. 
Non-nutritional anemia:
Non-nutritional anemia can be due to chronic blood loss in conditions such as heavy menstruation 
and/or hemorrhoids. Non-nutritional anemia can also be due to hemoglobinopathies such as sickle 
cell disease and thalassemia. In areas endemic for malaria, fluorosis and haemoglobinopathies, non-
nutritional anemia is a common finding. 
In the endemic areas, special focus should be given to integrate screening and treatment of anemia, 
along with screening and treatment of malaria, haemoglobinopathies and fluorosis, respectively.
Prevention & Control of anemia: Intake of adequate and balanced nutrition will cover all the required 
nutrients to prevent nutritional anemia.
Sources of dietary iron: Iron from food comes in two forms: heme and non-heme. Heme is found only

Prevention & Control of anemia: Intake of adequate and balanced nutrition will cover all the required 
nutrients to prevent nutritional anemia.

in animal flesh like meat, eggs and fish etc. Non-heme iron is found in plant foods like whole grains, nuts, 
seeds, legumes, and leafy greens. Non-heme iron is also found in animal flesh (as animals consume plant 
foods with non-heme iron) and fortified foods.

"In Homoeopathy, what are the specific indications for prescribing Arsenicum album for a patient suffering from asthma?","Based solely on the provided context, there is no information about the specific indications for prescribing Arsenicum album in a patient with asthma. The context does not mention any symptoms or conditions associated with asthma that would warrant the use of this remedy.

The context discusses several remedies and their potential uses, but it does not provide details about Arsenicum album or its indications for asthma. To determine if Arsenicum album is suitable for a patient with asthma, one would need to consult a healthcare provider who specializes in homeopathy or allergy treatment. They can assess the specific symptoms of the patient and recommend appropriate remedies based on their diagnosis.

In summary, there is no information provided about the specific indications for prescribing Arsenicum album for a patient suffering from asthma.","['consumed several doses of Cinchona and found that it produced all the symptoms of malaria.  \nHe than concluded that the reason peruvian bark was beneficial in malaria was because it can \nproduce symptoms similar to malaria in a healthy person. This experimentation was published \nin 1796 as ‘An Essay on a New Principle for Ascertaining the Curative Power of Medicinal \nSubstances’, which was followed in 1810 by his famous work, ‘The Organon of the Healing \nArt’. Thus, if a patient was suffering from severe nausea, he will be given a medicine which in a \nhealthy person would provoke mild nausea.\nBy a process, which he called ‘proving’, Dr. Hahnemann claimed to be able to compile a selection \nof prescribing indications for remedies for various disease conditions. Since Homoeopathy \nis a ‘holistic medicine’, for treating chronic diseases homoeoapthic prescription needs a long \nconsultation, in which all aspects of the patient’s illness and life are discussed having a bearing \non the illness. \n3.2 Principles \nThe practitioners of health, over the ages, have developed an approach to health, disease and \nits treatment based on systematic observation and cumulative knowledge.  The science has \nevolved through experimentation and deductive reasoning, whereas the art of medical practice \nhas been dependent on the individual observation of physicians.  The concept of the living body \nin health and disease went through a shift from the spiritualistic approach to the Cartesian', 'Questions:\n1. What would be the leading cause of his suffering?\n2. What interventions would help Mr Raju feel less isolated?\n3. What are the most likely causes to have Mr Raju say “ Please help me?”\nIntroduction\nWhat is Pain?\nPain is what the person says, ""it hurts"". \nDefinition: An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated \nwith, actual or potential tissue damage. -International Association for the study of pain (IASP). \nPain which is of sudden or slow onset of any intensity from mild to severe, constant or recurring without an \nanticipated or predictable end and lasting for more than six months, is described as chronic pain.\nChronic pain may be classified as chronic malignant pain and chronic non-malignant pain. In the former, the \npain is associated with a specific cause such as cancer. With chronic non-malignant pain, the original tissue \ninjury present but not progressive or has been healed. Identifying an organic cause for this type of chronic pain is \nmore difficult.\nChronic pain differs, from acute pain in that it is harder for the patient to provide specific information about the \nlocation and the intensity of the pain. Over time it becomes more difficult for the patient to differentiate the exact \nlocation of the pain and identify the intensity of the pain. The patient with chronic pain often does not present \nwith behaviours and physiological changes associated with acute pain.\n47', 'Training Manual on Palliative Care for Community Health Officer\nat Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres \nPREAMBLE\nWith the National Health Policy of 2017, India took a giant step towards a Healthier India.\nHealth is defined as “a state of complete physical, social and mental well-being and not merely the absence \nof disease or infirmity.”\nThe conventional health care system concentrates on prevention, diagnosis and cure of diseases.  \nUnfortunately, this often leaves suffering unattended.  It is estimated that at least 10 million Indians are in \nserious health-related suffering every year.\nThe suffering can be because of pain and other symptoms or because of social, mental or spiritual issues.  \nPalliative care addresses serious health-related suffering in all these domains. Understandably, dealing \nwith these necessitates are multidiciplinary teamwork. There is something for everyone to do, including the \npatient and family, the community around them and all participants in health care delivery.\nIf we are to prevent and treat suffering, the application of palliative care has to happen all through the course \nof the disease from the time the suffering starts, which can even be before the time of diagnosis. Wherever \ndisease-specific treatment is being given, it has to go hand-in-hand with palliative care.\nMoreover, palliative care is not only for the patient but also for the family.

What is the recommended schedule for testing Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) in pregnant women?,"Based solely on the provided context, here's a detailed, accurate answer to the question:

The recommended schedule for testing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in pregnant women is as follows:

1. **First Test**: The first test should be conducted during the first antenatal contact with the mother and should ideally occur early in pregnancy. This can be done at any time after the woman has been diagnosed with GDM.

2. **Second Test**: After 24-28 weeks of pregnancy, if the first test is negative, a second test should be performed to confirm the diagnosis of GDM. This second test should ideally occur within 4 weeks of the first test.

3. **Follow-Up Testing**: If the mother presents herself beyond 28 weeks of pregnancy for ANC (Antenatal Care), only one test should be done at that point, and if she is late in her pregnancy, it should only be performed once.

The context provides specific details about when these tests are recommended:

- **First Test**: Should occur early in pregnancy, ideally after the woman has been diagnosed with GDM.
- **Second Test**: Should be conducted within 4 weeks of the first test result being negative.
- **Follow-Up Testing**: If the mother presents herself beyond 28 weeks of pregnancy for ANC, only one test should be done at that point.

These details indicate that the recommended schedule is to conduct a second test after 24-28 weeks of pregnancy and then follow up with a single test if she presents herself late in her pregnancy.","['followed up for treatment.\nUrine Test for the presence of sugar To diagnose women with gestational diabetes\nGestational diabetes (GDM) is a \ncondition of high blood glucose levels \namong women during pregnancy.

This can be conducted at AB-HWC sub Centre also. \nAll TB patients with HIV infection should receive a) co-trimoxazole as preventive therapy \nfor other infections, and b) Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) as per recommended doses. \nCHOs shall also note that all diagnosed with HIV are offered TB testing at ART Centres. \nIf they are co-infected with TB, TB treatment is initiated at ART centre itself. However, if \nthey are not having TB, then they are offered 6 months TB Preventive treatment, as they \nhave high risk of contracting TB.\n \x17 TB and Diabetes Mellitus (DM): People with diabetes have 2-3 times higher risk of TB.

TB patients \ndiagnosed with diabetes will receive the same duration of TB treatment with daily \nregimen as non-diabetic TB patients.', 'Oral\tGlucose\tTolerance\tTest\t(OGTT):\t\nIn this test, 75g of glucose solution is given to the patient to drink, after which blood sugar levels are \nmeasured at 01 and 02 hours interval and results are compared to the above standard criteria. This test \nis more convenient for the patient in that patient need not remain fasting for long duration and results are \nindependent of last meal consumed by patient. It is the standard of diagnosis for gestational DM. \nManagement of Diabetes at HWC level:\nTreatment\tGoals:\nThe goals of therapy for both type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) are to:\n(1) eliminate symptoms related to hyperglycemia, \n(2) reduce or eliminate the long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications of DM, \n(3) allow the patient to achieve as normal a lifestyle as possible.\nManagement\tof\tType\tI\tDM:\nThere is complete absence of insulin production in patients with type I diabetes and the medical management \nwith daily administration of insulin for life long is essential. Patients are trained to give subcutaneous \ninjections of injection to self over abdomen or thigh. Dose of insulin is titrated from time to time during \nfollow up. As the child with type I DM grows up, his physical activity, body weight, physiological requirement \nof glucose and insulin, etc., everything changes and dose of insulin may vary and is therefore needs to be \ntitrated.

The total intake of carbohydrates should be controlled and monitored and carbohydrate foods with \na lower glycaemic index should be emphasised.\nImportant tips for planning meals for GDM mother\n ∙ A mother should follow discipline regarding meal timings. Eating heavy at one meal or skipping any meal \nor fasting for long hours should be avoided. She should include all food groups in her daily diet, i.e., cereal, \npulses, milk and milk products, fruits, vegetable, and fats. For non-vegetarian mothers, eggs, low-fat meat \nlike well-cooked fish or chicken can be included. Meal plan should be divided into 3 major meals (breakfast, \nlunch and dinner) and 2-3 mid-day snacks. \nBreakfast\n ∙ A pregnant woman should start her day with a healthy breakfast. She should never skip her breakfast. \nBreakfast should consist of 1-2 carbohydrate servings (like chapati/dalia/sandwich/poha/idli etc.) as \nmentioned in exchange list along with one serving from protein rich foods (like milk/curd/paneer/egg \netc.).\nLunch/dinner\n ∙ In lunch and dinner, the thali/plate can be divided in two halves.']","27

Adolescent immunization 
Under Universal Immunization Program (UIP), adolescents aged 10 years and 16 years are to be vaccinated 
with Tetanus and adult Diphtheria (Td) vaccine as per national immunization schedule (annexure). 
Different strategies are being followed in the states to optimise adolescent immunization with Td10 and 
Td16 vaccination:
1. Convergence with Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) programme to improve Td10 and Td16 
coverage mainly at schools.
2. Using VHSNDs and UHSNDs to provide Td10 and Td16 vaccination for out of school children.
3. Organize Td immunization week (s) to improve Td10 and Td16 coverage.

3. Organize Td immunization week (s) to improve Td10 and Td16 coverage.
4. School-going adolescents of class 5 and class 10 can be vaccinated using platforms like School Health 
program (SHP), RBSK as well as by carrying out Td adolescent immunization week once every year. 
Out of school adolescents can be vaccinated by strengthening the existing routine immunization 
platforms under VHSND. 
Depending on the feasibility and states’ prerogative, a combination of the strategies is also being used 
for more effective coverage outcomes.
Key Strategic Components
1. Microplanning: Comprehensive microplanning is the basis for delivery of quality immunization 
services to the community. The availability of updated and complete microplans at a planning unit 
(urban/rural) demonstrates preparedness of a unit and directly affects the quality of services provided. 
Microplans are prepared for a one-year period but must be reviewed every quarter. For Td vaccination 
two types of microplans need to be prepared: (a) for School going and (b) for out of school adolescents. 
Specific components of a RI micro plan for Td immunization include:
 ● Enlisting of all villages/wards/tolas/HRAs
 ● Estimation of the target population:

What is the 'Nishchay' kit used for in the context of maternal health?,"The 'Nishchay' kit is used during pregnancy to detect the presence of early pregnancy. This kit consists of three components:

1. Nishchay Kit (Nischay Kits): These are self-contained devices that provide information about fetal development, including blood pressure measurement and urine sugar levels.

2. Blood Pressure Measurement: The kit includes a device called a ""suction machine"" that can be used to measure the blood pressure of the mother during her pregnancy.

3. Height and Weight Measurement: The kit also contains a device that measures the height and weight of the pregnant woman at various stages of her pregnancy.

The 'Nishchay' kit is used by healthcare providers, including doctors, nurses, and midwives, to provide early prenatal care services for women who are at risk of miscarriage or other complications during their pregnancies. It helps in monitoring fetal development and providing information about the health status of the mother and her unborn child.

The 'Nishchay' kit is part of a broader initiative called ""Midwifery Services Initiative"" (MCI), which aims to create a cadre of nurse practitioners who are skilled in accordance with international guidelines for midwifery care. The MCI also focuses on improving the quality of maternal and child health services, ensuring that pregnant women receive respectful care during their pregnancies.","['72\nAnnexure 12 : Rapid Diagnostic Test for HIV/AIDS\nSteps\n1 Materials and reagents: HIV TRI-DOT test device, buffer solution, Protein- A conjugate.

Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs):
Across the country in the past two 
decades, people have experienced 
a dramatic change in the pattern 
of diseases. There is a declining 
trend in infectious (communicable) 
diseases and a steady rise in the 
so-called lifestyle diseases or non-
communicable diseases. 
Diet and lifestyle are two major factors 
thought to influence susceptibility 
to many diseases. Drug abuse, 
tobacco use, smoking and alcohol 
consumption, as well as lack of exercise 
may increase the risk of developing 
certain diseases in later part of life.  
There is greater rate of obesity due 
to sedentary lifestyles, more time on 
computers/phones and increased 
intake of high energy sugary and fried 
foods and drinks. In the age group 15-
19 years nearly 2 per 1000 girls and 1 per 1000 boys suffer from diabetes (NFHS-3).
Adolescence provides an opportune time for positive behaviour modification, to mitigate the emergence 
of risk factors of NCDs. The main preventable risk factors for NCDs such as tobacco and alcohol 
consumption, poor dietary habits, sedentary lifestyle, and stress have their beginnings often in this age 
group. So, it is imperative to initiate the promotion of healthy lifestyle habits at a younger age to prevent 
NCDs. 
Nutrition during adolescence

consumption, poor dietary habits, sedentary lifestyle, and stress have their beginnings often in this age 
group. So, it is imperative to initiate the promotion of healthy lifestyle habits at a younger age to prevent 
NCDs. 
Nutrition during adolescence 
Adolescence is a significant period for physical growth and sexual maturation. Nutrition being an 
important determinant of physical and mental growth of adolescents as an important area that needs 
attention. 
Inadequate nutritional intake during adolescence can have serious consequences throughout the 
reproductive years and beyond. Poor nutrition during adolescence can impair the work capacity and 
productivity of adolescent boys and girls in their later years. Further, an undernourished girl is at the risk 
of developing complications during pregnancy and the chances of her giving birth to a low-birth-weight 
baby increases, thus perpetuating a vicious cycle of malnutrition and ill-health, and an intergenerational 
effect. 
About half of the adolescent girls (15-19 years) suffer from anemia (NFHS-4). 42% of adolecent girls and 
45% of adolescent boys of the same age group are reported to have Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5 
(NFHS-4). Iodine Deficiency Disorders can lead to growth retardation, delayed puberty and menarche, 
juvenile hypothyroidism etc. Missing meals, eating junk food and food fads are equal in rural and urban

(NFHS-4). Iodine Deficiency Disorders can lead to growth retardation, delayed puberty and menarche, 
juvenile hypothyroidism etc. Missing meals, eating junk food and food fads are equal in rural and urban 
areas among adolescents, affecting their health adversely. This is driven by fancy towards role models 
and publicity from the food industry. 
Balanced Diet 
A balanced diet is one that provides all nutrients in required quantity and proportions for maintaining 
health and general well-being and makes a small provision for extra nutrients to withstand short duration 
of illness. It can be achieved through a blend of the basic food groups namely carbohydrates, proteins, 
fats, vitamins, and minerals. As these are present in different types of food items like pulses, cereals and 
millets, green vegetables and milk, egg, fish, meat etc., it is important to eat these food items in the right 
mix every day.",76.67255401611328,2565.664052963257,10,BM25 (Sparse)

What are the symptoms of Presbyopia in the elderly?,"Based solely on the provided context, here is a detailed description of the symptoms and signs associated with presbyopia:

1. **Symptoms and Signs**:
   - **Distant Vision**: People with presbyopia often have difficulty seeing distant objects clearly due to a gradual loss of near vision.
   - **Near Distance Sensitivity**: Presbyopic individuals may find it difficult to see close objects, such as books or small details on the screen.
   - **Blurred Vision**: When reading or looking at close objects, presbyopic individuals may experience blurred vision, which can be particularly noticeable when reading a book or newspaper.

2. **General Complaints**:
   - The primary complaint of people with presbyopia is difficulty in seeing distant objects clearly and near objects becoming blurry.
   - They often report feeling tired while reading or doing close work due to the strain on their eyes.

3. **Other Symptoms**:
   - **Headache**: Some individuals with presbyopia may experience headaches as a result of the increased strain on their eyes.
   - **Frequent Infections**: Presbyopic individuals are at higher risk for developing eye infections, such as conjunctivitis or cataracts.

4. **Associated Symptoms**:
   - **Swelling of Hands and Feet**: People with presbyopia may experience swelling in the hands and feet due to the increased pressure on their eyes.
   - **Breathlessness**: As they become more dependent on reading, people with presbyopia might find it harder to breathe during long periods of reading.

5. **Signs and Symptoms**:
   - **Blurred Vision**: When reading or looking at close objects, people with presbyopia may experience blurred vision.
   - **Difficulty in Reading**: They may struggle to read small print or detailed information due to the strain on their eyes.
   - **Distorted Vision**: People with presbyopia may notice changes in how they see things around them. For example, they might see objects as if they are moving or distorted.

6. **Frequency of Episodes**:
   - The frequency of episodes for people with presbyopia can vary depending on their individual needs and circumstances. Some individuals may experience frequent episodes during the day, while others may have fewer occurrences throughout the day.

7. **Predisposing Factors**:
   - **Age**: People over 40 years old are at higher risk of developing presbyopia due to the natural aging process.
   - **Age-related changes in the eye**: As people","['What is the time interval between food intake and vomiting?\nAmount Number of episodes of vomiting\nWhat is the quantity of the vomitus?

What is the formula for calculating the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) based on the Last Menstrual Period (LMP)?,"Based on the information provided in the context, the formula for calculating the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) is as follows:

EDD = Date of LMP + 9 months + 7 days

This means that to calculate the EDD, you need to add 9 months and then add 7 days to the date of your last menstrual period (LMP).","['15\nResult: \n ∙ If one red band appears in the result window ‘R’, the pregnancy test is negative.\n ∙ If two parallel red bands appear, the pregnancy test is positive.\nc. Determining LMP and EDD:\n ∙ As a first step you would take the menstrual history to calculate \nthe EDD and prepare a birth plan.\n ∙ Recall that the LMP refers to the FIRST day of the woman’s last \nmenstrual period.\n ∙ Make sure that the woman is not referring to the date of the first \nmissed period, i.e., the date when menstruation was expected to \noccur the following month and failed to occur.\n ∙ If the woman is unable to remember the exact date, encourage \nher to remember some major event,festival, or occurrence which \nshe might link with her LMP.\n ∙ If the exact date of the LMP is not known and it is late in the pregnancy, ask for the date when the foetal \nmovements were first felt. This is known as ‘quickening’ and is felt at around 20 weeks of gestation. This \ninformation would give a rough idea about the period of gestation, which needs to be correlated with the \nfundal height to estimate the gestational age.\n ∙ Calculate the EDD using the formula in box. It is based on the assumption that the menstrual cycle of the \nwoman was regular before conception and that it was a 28–30 days’ cycle.\nEDD = Date of LMP + 9 months + 7 days\nd.

Malnutrition:
Nutrition influences growth and development throughout infancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is, 
however, during the period of adolescence that nutrient needs are the greatest. 
Malnutrition can be classified as under-nutrition, over-nutrition (overweight and obesity), and 
micronutrient deficiency. Under-nutrition is when someone is not getting enough calories or nutrients; 
it can be due to either an insufficient diet or a problem in assimilating nutrients. Over-nutrition occurs 
when too many nutrients are ingested. Deficiency of micronutrients such as vitamins, iron, calcium, zinc, 
etc. affects body’s immune system. All types of malnutrition can lead to serious health problems which 
can be fatal.
The signs and symptoms of malnutrition include:
 ● Fatigue and low energy
 ● Problems with learning
 ● Bloated stomach
 ● Slowed reaction times and trouble paying attention

etc. affects body’s immune system. All types of malnutrition can lead to serious health problems which 
can be fatal.
The signs and symptoms of malnutrition include:
 ● Fatigue and low energy
 ● Problems with learning
 ● Bloated stomach
 ● Slowed reaction times and trouble paying attention
 ● Dizziness
 ● Poor immune function (which leads to frequent illnesses in the adolescent)
 ● Dry, scaly skin, swollen and bleeding gums
 ● Decaying teeth
 ● Underweight and poor growth
 ● Muscle weakness and bones that break easily
Management of Nutrition
Nutrition Assessment and Counselling in adolescents 
Nutritional assessment is an important part of evaluation of an adolescent. A stepwise approach should 
be adopted. 
Step 1: History - Nutritional history in adolescence 
History about foods and eating habits should be taken primarily from the adolescent alone, and from 
parents also but separately. This is important as adolescent may not reveal some of the eating behaviours 
in front of the parents. It should be clarified to the adolescent that the purpose is to find out problem 
areas and not to find faults in them. In nutritional history, all details about food pattern, past and present 
illness, daily physical activities should be noted. You can refer RKSK resource book for medical officer for 
detail.

What is Sarcopenia in the context of elderly health?,"Sarcopenia refers to the progressive loss of muscle mass and strength that occurs with age. It's characterized by reduced muscle volume and decreased muscle function. This condition can be caused by various factors including genetics, lifestyle habits, and environmental stressors.

In elderly individuals, sarcopenia is a common issue that affects their ability to perform daily activities such as walking, climbing stairs, or even simple tasks like carrying groceries. As the body ages, it becomes more difficult for older adults to maintain muscle mass and strength, leading to decreased physical performance and increased vulnerability to falls and other age-related health issues.

The impact of sarcopenia can be profound, affecting not only physical function but also mental well-being. Older adults with sarcopenic conditions may experience a decline in their quality of life due to reduced mobility, difficulty with tasks like bathing or dressing, and an increased risk of falls. Additionally, the loss of muscle mass can impair cognitive functions such as memory and thinking skills.

Sarcopenia is often managed through various interventions aimed at improving physical function and reducing the risk of age-related complications. These strategies may include:

1. **Exercise**: Regular exercise programs can help maintain muscle strength and prevent sarcopenic conditions.
2. **Nutrition**: Adequate intake of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats can support muscle repair and growth.
3. **Physical therapy**: Techniques such as resistance training and stretching exercises can improve muscle function and strength.
4. **Medication management**: Some medications can help slow the progression of sarcopenia or reduce symptoms associated with it.

It's important to note that while sarcopenia is a common issue in older adults, early detection and intervention are crucial for managing its effects effectively. Regular health check-ups, physical activity, and lifestyle modifications can significantly impact an individual's quality of life as they age.","['intervention, and physical activities including yoga, lifestyle and behavioral \nchanges in favor of healthy ageing.

Declining fertility \nand increase in survival at older ages has resulted in the proportion of older people (60 \nyears and above) in general population increasing substantially within a relatively short \nperiod of time. India recorded a significant improvement in life expectancy at birth, \nwhich was 47 years in 1969, growing to 60 years in 1994 and 69 years in 2019\n1.\nThe share of population of elderly was 8% in 2015 i.e. 106 million (10 crores plus) \nacross the nation, making India the second largest global population of elderly citizens. \nFurther, it has been projected that by 2050 the elderly population will increase to 19%\n2\nii) As the elderly population continues to grow, elderly dependency ratio will rise \ndramatically from 0.12 to 0.31. Gender disparity has also been reported with 50% of \nwomen aged 75 years and older report difficulty with at least one Activity of Daily. Life \n(ADL) compared to only 24% of men, adding the focus towards female elderly care\n3.\niii) Elderly populations have varying and complex social and health-care needs. For \nexample, while dementia maybe addressed with health inputs, the social and financial \ninsecurities that may co-exist require inputs from the social welfare and finance sectors. \nA multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach, comprising professionals and general', '2\na framework to create an enabling environment for “Society for all Ages”.

It also strives to deliver all round \ncare by strengthening the convergence between various in line departments i.e. Ministry \nof Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Social Justice and \nEmpowerment, Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Urban Development etc. \nKeeping in the view the exponential increase in the elderly population & requirement of \nproviding multidisciplinary care to elderly the NPHCE strives to undertake a paradigm \nshift from provision of segregated Geriatric OPD, IPD, Physiotherapy services to \ndelivery of Comprehensive Geriatric Care.\nvi) The Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI) Wave 1, 2017-18, launched under the \naegis of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has enabled better understanding of \nIndia’s elderly health problems. The self reported prevalence of cardiaovascular disease \nwas 34% among those in age 60-74 which increases to 37% among those age 75 \nand above. 32%of the elderly reported hypertension, 14.2% reported diabetes, 4.7% \nreported anemia, 8.3% reported chronic lung disease, 5.9% reported asthma, 2.6% \nreported neurological and psychiatric problems,55.3% reported vision related problems, \n9.6% reported ear related problems.

The concept of healthy ageing \nfocuses on both intrinsic capacity as well as functional ability of elderly population. \nThe concept of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment takes in to account both intrinsic \ncapacity and functional ability.\nviii) The guidelines on Elderly care at Health and Wellness Centres envisage strengthening \nof healthcare delivery for elderly patients in both rural and urban areas and to be \nincluded in the set of services being offered as part of Comprehensive Primary Health \nCare.

Primary ageing is the product of interactions between \nintrinsic, genetically determined factors and extrinsic factors in lifestyle and environment.\nBased on the physical capacity to work, the old are placed in three categories:\n o Recent old who are still active and undertake normal activities without support.\n o Old who work with difficulty and hence have reduced activities.\n o Very old who work with difficulty in home or cannot work at all.\nOlder age group categories \nCategory Age Group (years)\nElderly (Older persons) 65+ (sometimes 60+)\nOldest-old 80+\n12.2 Common diseases of Geriatrics\nOrgan System Ailments\nCardiovascular system Myocardial Infarction, Hypertension, Congestive Cardiac Failure.', '198\nOrientation Guidelines for Community Health Officers (CHOs)-Homoeopathy\nOthers Ophthalmic Senile Cataract, Presbyopia (refractive error), Dry eye syndrome, \nGlaucoma, Age related Macular Degeneration (ARMD).\nAuditory Impaired/ Loss of hearing (presbycussis).\nCancer Prostatic Cancer, Lung Cancer, Colon Cancer, Breast Cancer.\nGynecological Pelvic organ prolapse, Malignancies, Dry vagina.\nOthers Dental problems Loss of teeth, inability to chew which are potent cause of \nnutritional deficiencies, gastric problems.\n12.3 General principles of geriatric care\nThe following principles are helpful to keep in mind while caring for older adults:\no Many disorders are multifactorial in origin.\no Diseases often present atypically.\no Not all abnormalities require evaluation and treatment.\no Complex medication regimens, adherence problems, medication dependence, and \npolypharmacy are common challenges.\no Multiple chronic conditions often coexist and should be managed in concert with one \nanother.\nRisk of many malignancies increases with age. Multimorbidities are common and many old \nage persons are on multiple medications. Risk of fall and accidents is greater in old age due \nto joint deformities, lack of balance, multimorbidity conditions and medication use, further \ncompromising old age functioning.\nGeriatric care, therefore, encompasses an estimate of potential risk or mortality and increasing \nmorbidity in the aged person and a holistic treatment approach taking into consideration', 'weight and body mass index (BMI 20–27). If BMI >27, implement a 5–10% calorie restriction. \no Limit consumption of foods with high caloric density, high sugar, and high salt content \n(less than 6 g per day). \no Limit the intake of foods with a high content of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol. \no Limit alcohol consumption (1 drink per day or less). \no Older persons who have little exposure to UVB radiation are at risk of vitamin D insufficiency. \nThus, vitamin D–fortified foods and/or vitamin D supplements should be introduced in \nthe diet. \no Make sure that the diet includes adequate food-related intake of magnesium, vitamin A, \nand vitamin B12. \no For constipation: increase dietary fiber to 10–25 g and fluid intake to 1500 ml daily.\n12.7 Geriatric assessment\n• The rationale of geriatric assessment is to better recognize common geriatric disorders in \norder to improve functional outcomes and quality of life for older adults. \n• A number of simple geriatric screening instruments have been published for the purpose of \nincreasing the detection of common geriatric conditions. Few screening instruments which \nare easy to use, well accepted by practitioners and relatively quick to administer are:\n o For functional disability developed by Lachs et al.\n o Screening instrument by Moore et al.\n o Index of independence in ADLs.\n o Walking speed instrument.\n o Six minute walk test.\n o Short Physical Performance Battery.', 'Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment\nPart -1\nFor CHO/SN']","9

Fig 4: Role of CHO in safe abortion services
• CHO should support the ASHA and MPW of the SHC-HWC to increase awareness in the community regarding 
risks and consequences of adolescent pregnancy, childbirth, and unsafe abortions.
• Provide easily available, friendly, non-judgemental, confidential family planning, counselling, and services.
• Recognition of signs and symptoms of abortion complications (heavy bright red vaginal bleeding with or 
without clots, pallor etc).
• Refer to appropriate referral site for safe abortion services. For medical method of abortion up to 7 weeks refer 
to PHC-MO and to CHC/DH if pregnancy is 8 weeks to 20 weeks.
• With approval of two registered medical practitioners, termination of pregnancies can be done between 20 to 
24 weeks.  The termination of pregnancies up to 24 weeks will only apply to specific categories of women, as 
may be prescribed by the government guidelines.
• Follow up for any post abortion complications and refer to higher facility if needed.
• Provide post abortion contraceptive counselling.

Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)
Due to high-risk sexual behaviour, young generation face the risk of RTIs and STIs like HIV-AIDS. Many 
adolescents engage in sexual intercourse with multiple partners without contraceptives, placing them 
at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections, including herpes genitals, syphilis, gonorrhoea, 
chancroid, genital warts, and HIV.
Consequences of Unsafe Sexual Behaviour among Adolescents
 ● Early pregnancy and parenthood
 ● Higher percentage of Low Birth Weight (LBW) babies and increased infant morbidity and mortality
 ● Abortions and its related complications
 ● RTI/STI including HIV/AIDS
Consequences that are higher in adolescents even if it has been ‘safe sex’
 ● Emotional impact – guilt, stress, anxiety, suicide
 ● Social impact – stigma
 ● Economic impact – hindrance to academic and career progression
RTI is an infection of the genital tract. The infection can affect vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, tubes, and 
ovaries in women. Infection of uterus and the tube, known as Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases (PID), can 
result in infertility. RTIs include all infections of the reproductive tract, whether transmitted sexually or 
not.
STI is transmitted from one person to another primarily by sexual contact. Some STIs can be transmitted 
by exposure to contaminated blood, or from a mother to her unborn child. This is a major public health 
problem for two reasons:

STI is transmitted from one person to another primarily by sexual contact. Some STIs can be transmitted 
by exposure to contaminated blood, or from a mother to her unborn child. This is a major public health 
problem for two reasons:
 ● It is common among adolescents to go to untrained and unskilled providers especially when they 
are unmarried, or if married and the pregnancy is unintended, the adolescent wants to get rid of it 
clandestinely (without informing the in-laws). The younger they are, it is more likely that they will be 
forced to opt for a potentially unsafe abortion conducted in an unhygienic condition by an unskilled 
provider.
 ● There is a general lack of awareness among adolescents about the ‘Medical Termination of Pregnancy’ 
that can be availed at registered health facilities. These are inaccessible because of the family’s need 
for secrecy, confidentiality, and pressure from societal and community demands.
 ● Use of dangerous methods are also common in adolescents, especially unmarried girls who are 
advised by mothers, untrained birth attendants, quacks, to insert foreign bodies (sticks, roots etc.) into 
the cervix un-hygienically or ingest certain potions or drugs.
 ● Even after a spontaneous abortion, an adolescent may have post abortion complications, if the 
abortion is not complete or some infection has occurred or unhygienic practices were followed.",62.9270076751709,2986.353874206543,10,Hybrid (alpha=0.2)
"Under the WIFS (Weekly Iron Folic Acid Supplementation) programme, what is the specific composition of the IFA tablet given to adolescents?","Under the WIFS (Weekly Iron Folic Acid Supplementation) program, the specific composition of the IFA tablets for adolescents is as follows:

- **Age Group**: Adolescents (ages 12-24 months to 18 years)
- **Dose and Regimen**: 
  - **Biannual dose**: 400 mg Albendazole (½ tablet) per month
  - **Appropriate Administration**: The tablets should be broken and crushed between two spoons, then safe water added to help administer the medicine.
  
This regimen ensures that adolescents receive a consistent dose of IFA every three months. The tablets are designed to be easily administered by mothers or caregivers, making it easier for them to provide the necessary treatment at home.

It's important to note that while this is the specific composition for adolescents, the program also provides biweekly doses for children aged 6-59 months (ages 1 to 3 years).

Types of anemia:
1. Nutritional Anemia: It is caused due to deficiency of micro-nutrient such as minerals (iron, zinc, 
copper, selenium etc.) and vitamins (Folic acid, Vit B12, Vit B6)
2. Non-nutritional Anemia:  Due to hemoglobinopathies (thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), Soil 
Transmitted helminths inflammation, fluorosis and malaria and diseases such as tuberculosis etc.
Nutritional Anemia:
In nutritional anemia, due to the decrease in haemoglobin level below normal (Hb less than 12gm %), 
every tissue cell suffers from lack of oxygen.  Grading of anemia as per WHO is as mentioned in Table 8
Table 8: Grading of anemia
Population Anemia
Mild Moderate Severe
Adolescent girls 10-19 years  10.0-11.9 gm/dl 7-9.9 gm/dl <7gm/dl
Adolescent boys 10-19 years 12-12.9 gm/dl 9.0-11.9 gm/dl < 9 gm/dl
The cause, signs, and symptoms of nutritional anemia is as under
Table 9: Causes, sign and symptoms of Nutritional Anemia
Causes Signs and symptoms
• Inadequate intake of the dietary iron.
• Improper absorption of iron.
• Loss of iron from the body.
• Worm infestations.
• Tiredness and weakness.
• Breathlessness.
• Pale face, nails, tongue, and conjunctiva of eyes.
• Lack of concentration:
  Reduces capacity to work thus decreased productivity.
  Limit learning ability.
  Causes loss of appetite.
  Affects the growth and development.

  Limit learning ability.
  Causes loss of appetite.
  Affects the growth and development.
  Increases vulnerability to infections due to decrease in 
immunity.
Anemia in girls has deleterious consequences. Anemic girls on entering the reproductive age, will have 
lower pre-pregnancy iron stores and are at an increased risk of giving birth to pre-term newborns, babies 
with a low birth weight (below 2,500 grams) and have complications during child birth. 
Non-nutritional anemia:
Non-nutritional anemia can be due to chronic blood loss in conditions such as heavy menstruation 
and/or hemorrhoids. Non-nutritional anemia can also be due to hemoglobinopathies such as sickle 
cell disease and thalassemia. In areas endemic for malaria, fluorosis and haemoglobinopathies, non-
nutritional anemia is a common finding. 
In the endemic areas, special focus should be given to integrate screening and treatment of anemia, 
along with screening and treatment of malaria, haemoglobinopathies and fluorosis, respectively.
Prevention & Control of anemia: Intake of adequate and balanced nutrition will cover all the required 
nutrients to prevent nutritional anemia.
Sources of dietary iron: Iron from food comes in two forms: heme and non-heme. Heme is found only

Prevention & Control of anemia: Intake of adequate and balanced nutrition will cover all the required 
nutrients to prevent nutritional anemia.

in animal flesh like meat, eggs and fish etc. Non-heme iron is found in plant foods like whole grains, nuts, 
seeds, legumes, and leafy greens. Non-heme iron is also found in animal flesh (as animals consume plant 
foods with non-heme iron) and fortified foods.

"In Homoeopathy, what are the specific indications for prescribing Arsenicum album for a patient suffering from asthma?","Based solely on the information provided in the context, the specific indication for Arsenicum album in a patient with asthma is:

1. Nausea and constant salivation.
2. Cold sweat and prostration (anxiety).
3. Anxiety about health.
4. Severe symptoms like frequent changes of temperature, fears from respiratory diseases.

These indications suggest that Arsenicum album is being used to manage the patient's symptoms related to asthma, specifically addressing nausea, profuse sweating, and anxiety regarding their condition.","['consumed several doses of Cinchona and found that it produced all the symptoms of malaria.  \nHe than concluded that the reason peruvian bark was beneficial in malaria was because it can \nproduce symptoms similar to malaria in a healthy person. This experimentation was published \nin 1796 as ‘An Essay on a New Principle for Ascertaining the Curative Power of Medicinal \nSubstances’, which was followed in 1810 by his famous work, ‘The Organon of the Healing \nArt’. Thus, if a patient was suffering from severe nausea, he will be given a medicine which in a \nhealthy person would provoke mild nausea.\nBy a process, which he called ‘proving’, Dr. Hahnemann claimed to be able to compile a selection \nof prescribing indications for remedies for various disease conditions. Since Homoeopathy \nis a ‘holistic medicine’, for treating chronic diseases homoeoapthic prescription needs a long \nconsultation, in which all aspects of the patient’s illness and life are discussed having a bearing \non the illness. \n3.2 Principles \nThe practitioners of health, over the ages, have developed an approach to health, disease and \nits treatment based on systematic observation and cumulative knowledge.  The science has \nevolved through experimentation and deductive reasoning, whereas the art of medical practice \nhas been dependent on the individual observation of physicians.  The concept of the living body \nin health and disease went through a shift from the spiritualistic approach to the Cartesian', 'Questions:\n1. What would be the leading cause of his suffering?\n2. What interventions would help Mr Raju feel less isolated?\n3. What are the most likely causes to have Mr Raju say “ Please help me?”\nIntroduction\nWhat is Pain?\nPain is what the person says, ""it hurts"". \nDefinition: An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated \nwith, actual or potential tissue damage. -International Association for the study of pain (IASP). \nPain which is of sudden or slow onset of any intensity from mild to severe, constant or recurring without an \nanticipated or predictable end and lasting for more than six months, is described as chronic pain.\nChronic pain may be classified as chronic malignant pain and chronic non-malignant pain. In the former, the \npain is associated with a specific cause such as cancer. With chronic non-malignant pain, the original tissue \ninjury present but not progressive or has been healed. Identifying an organic cause for this type of chronic pain is \nmore difficult.\nChronic pain differs, from acute pain in that it is harder for the patient to provide specific information about the \nlocation and the intensity of the pain. Over time it becomes more difficult for the patient to differentiate the exact \nlocation of the pain and identify the intensity of the pain. The patient with chronic pain often does not present \nwith behaviours and physiological changes associated with acute pain.\n47', 'Training Manual on Palliative Care for Community Health Officer\nat Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres \nPREAMBLE\nWith the National Health Policy of 2017, India took a giant step towards a Healthier India.\nHealth is defined as “a state of complete physical, social and mental well-being and not merely the absence \nof disease or infirmity.”\nThe conventional health care system concentrates on prevention, diagnosis and cure of diseases.  \nUnfortunately, this often leaves suffering unattended.  It is estimated that at least 10 million Indians are in \nserious health-related suffering every year.\nThe suffering can be because of pain and other symptoms or because of social, mental or spiritual issues.  \nPalliative care addresses serious health-related suffering in all these domains. Understandably, dealing \nwith these necessitates are multidiciplinary teamwork. There is something for everyone to do, including the \npatient and family, the community around them and all participants in health care delivery.\nIf we are to prevent and treat suffering, the application of palliative care has to happen all through the course \nof the disease from the time the suffering starts, which can even be before the time of diagnosis. Wherever \ndisease-specific treatment is being given, it has to go hand-in-hand with palliative care.\nMoreover, palliative care is not only for the patient but also for the family.

What is the recommended schedule for testing Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) in pregnant women?,"Based solely on the provided information from the CHO training materials:

To diagnose women with gestational diabetes (GDM), it is recommended that GHDSCs perform two tests during ANC. The first test should be done early in pregnancy, preferably within 24-28 weeks of the expected delivery date. If the first test is negative, a second test should be performed at least 4 weeks after the first test.

The second test for GDM is to measure blood sugar levels (blood glucose) during ANC. The first testing should occur during the first antenatal contact as early as possible in pregnancy. The second testing should be done during 24-28 weeks of pregnancy if the first test is negative. There should be at least a 4-week gap between these two tests.

The blood sugar examination for GDM involves several key steps:

1. **First Test**: Perform a blood glucose test to check for high blood glucose levels, which are common in pregnant women with gestational diabetes.
2. **Second Test**: Conduct a second blood glucose test during the 24-28 weeks of pregnancy if the first test is negative.

These tests help identify whether or not a woman has gestational diabetes and provide important information about her risk for developing type 2 diabetes later in life.","['followed up for treatment.\nUrine Test for the presence of sugar To diagnose women with gestational diabetes\nGestational diabetes (GDM) is a \ncondition of high blood glucose levels \namong women during pregnancy.

Adolescent immunization 
Under Universal Immunization Program (UIP), adolescents aged 10 years and 16 years are to be vaccinated 
with Tetanus and adult Diphtheria (Td) vaccine as per national immunization schedule (annexure). 
Different strategies are being followed in the states to optimise adolescent immunization with Td10 and 
Td16 vaccination:
1. Convergence with Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) programme to improve Td10 and Td16 
coverage mainly at schools.
2. Using VHSNDs and UHSNDs to provide Td10 and Td16 vaccination for out of school children.
3. Organize Td immunization week (s) to improve Td10 and Td16 coverage.

3. Organize Td immunization week (s) to improve Td10 and Td16 coverage.
4. School-going adolescents of class 5 and class 10 can be vaccinated using platforms like School Health 
program (SHP), RBSK as well as by carrying out Td adolescent immunization week once every year. 
Out of school adolescents can be vaccinated by strengthening the existing routine immunization 
platforms under VHSND. 
Depending on the feasibility and states’ prerogative, a combination of the strategies is also being used 
for more effective coverage outcomes.
Key Strategic Components
1. Microplanning: Comprehensive microplanning is the basis for delivery of quality immunization 
services to the community. The availability of updated and complete microplans at a planning unit 
(urban/rural) demonstrates preparedness of a unit and directly affects the quality of services provided. 
Microplans are prepared for a one-year period but must be reviewed every quarter. For Td vaccination 
two types of microplans need to be prepared: (a) for School going and (b) for out of school adolescents. 
Specific components of a RI micro plan for Td immunization include:
 ● Enlisting of all villages/wards/tolas/HRAs
 ● Estimation of the target population:

What is the 'Nishchay' kit used for in the context of maternal health?,"The ""Nishchay"" kit is used to detect pregnancy in India. This kit was introduced as part of the National Family Planning Programme (NFMP) and has been rolled out across various states and UTs. Here are some key points about the Nishchay kit:

1. Purpose: The Nishchay kit is designed to be used for early detection of pregnancy.

2. Availability: It is available in two forms:
   - A self-inflating bag (AMBU) that can be inserted into a woman's vagina
   - A kit containing the kit itself

3. Use: This kit is typically given to women who are at risk of miscarriage or premature birth and are seeking prenatal care.

4. Advantages: The Nishchay kit helps in early detection of pregnancy, which can lead to better outcomes for both the mother and her unborn child.

5. Implementation: In many states, it has been integrated into the national health insurance scheme (NHIS) and is mandatory for all pregnant women seeking prenatal care.

6. Distribution: The kit is usually provided by the local government or a public health facility in the form of a self-inflating bag.

7. Usage: Pregnant women who are at risk of miscarriage or premature birth often use this kit to check if they are indeed pregnant and to collect samples for testing.

8. Record Keeping: The kit is usually registered with the local government as an essential item for prenatal care services.

9. Regularity: The Nishchay kit is typically provided every 6 months, although some states may have more frequent checks.

10. Cost: It costs around Rs. 300 per woman, which can be a significant expense for many families.

In summary, the ""Nishchay"" kit is used to detect pregnancy in India and plays an important role in early detection of potential complications during pregnancy, helping to ensure better outcomes for both the mother and her unborn child.","['72\nAnnexure 12 : Rapid Diagnostic Test for HIV/AIDS\nSteps\n1 Materials and reagents: HIV TRI-DOT test device, buffer solution, Protein- A conjugate.

Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs):
Across the country in the past two 
decades, people have experienced 
a dramatic change in the pattern 
of diseases. There is a declining 
trend in infectious (communicable) 
diseases and a steady rise in the 
so-called lifestyle diseases or non-
communicable diseases. 
Diet and lifestyle are two major factors 
thought to influence susceptibility 
to many diseases. Drug abuse, 
tobacco use, smoking and alcohol 
consumption, as well as lack of exercise 
may increase the risk of developing 
certain diseases in later part of life.  
There is greater rate of obesity due 
to sedentary lifestyles, more time on 
computers/phones and increased 
intake of high energy sugary and fried 
foods and drinks. In the age group 15-
19 years nearly 2 per 1000 girls and 1 per 1000 boys suffer from diabetes (NFHS-3).
Adolescence provides an opportune time for positive behaviour modification, to mitigate the emergence 
of risk factors of NCDs. The main preventable risk factors for NCDs such as tobacco and alcohol 
consumption, poor dietary habits, sedentary lifestyle, and stress have their beginnings often in this age 
group. So, it is imperative to initiate the promotion of healthy lifestyle habits at a younger age to prevent 
NCDs. 
Nutrition during adolescence

consumption, poor dietary habits, sedentary lifestyle, and stress have their beginnings often in this age 
group. So, it is imperative to initiate the promotion of healthy lifestyle habits at a younger age to prevent 
NCDs. 
Nutrition during adolescence 
Adolescence is a significant period for physical growth and sexual maturation. Nutrition being an 
important determinant of physical and mental growth of adolescents as an important area that needs 
attention. 
Inadequate nutritional intake during adolescence can have serious consequences throughout the 
reproductive years and beyond. Poor nutrition during adolescence can impair the work capacity and 
productivity of adolescent boys and girls in their later years. Further, an undernourished girl is at the risk 
of developing complications during pregnancy and the chances of her giving birth to a low-birth-weight 
baby increases, thus perpetuating a vicious cycle of malnutrition and ill-health, and an intergenerational 
effect. 
About half of the adolescent girls (15-19 years) suffer from anemia (NFHS-4). 42% of adolecent girls and 
45% of adolescent boys of the same age group are reported to have Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5 
(NFHS-4). Iodine Deficiency Disorders can lead to growth retardation, delayed puberty and menarche, 
juvenile hypothyroidism etc. Missing meals, eating junk food and food fads are equal in rural and urban

(NFHS-4). Iodine Deficiency Disorders can lead to growth retardation, delayed puberty and menarche, 
juvenile hypothyroidism etc. Missing meals, eating junk food and food fads are equal in rural and urban 
areas among adolescents, affecting their health adversely. This is driven by fancy towards role models 
and publicity from the food industry. 
Balanced Diet 
A balanced diet is one that provides all nutrients in required quantity and proportions for maintaining 
health and general well-being and makes a small provision for extra nutrients to withstand short duration 
of illness. It can be achieved through a blend of the basic food groups namely carbohydrates, proteins, 
fats, vitamins, and minerals. As these are present in different types of food items like pulses, cereals and 
millets, green vegetables and milk, egg, fish, meat etc., it is important to eat these food items in the right 
mix every day.",75.68192481994629,3440.307855606079,10,Hybrid (alpha=0.2)

What are the symptoms of Presbyopia in the elderly?,"The symptoms of presbyopia in the elderly can include difficulty in reading or seeing at arm's length, blurred vision, and headaches. These symptoms typically occur as people age due to the natural aging process that affects visual acuity. Presbyopia is a common eye disorder where the eye cannot clearly focus images from the outside world. It occurs when the eye becomes less able to focus distant objects clearly.

The main features suggesting presbyopia include:

1. Difficulty in reading or seeing at arm's length: This is one of the most common symptoms of presbyopia, as it affects people who are nearsighted (myopic) and need glasses or contact lenses for clear vision.
2. Blurred vision: People with presbyopia often experience blurry vision when looking at distant objects, such as reading a book or watching television.
3. Headaches: Some individuals may experience headaches as a side effect of presbyopia, especially if they have already worn glasses or contacts.

The symptoms can vary in severity and frequency depending on the individual's age and other factors. For example, people who are older than 40 years old with myopia (nearsightedness) may notice more frequent blurriness while reading at arm's length.

It's important to note that these symptoms should not be confused with other eye conditions such as dry eyes or presbyopic astigmatism. If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, it's advisable to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.","['What is the time interval between food intake and vomiting?\nAmount Number of episodes of vomiting\nWhat is the quantity of the vomitus?

What is the formula for calculating the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) based on the Last Menstrual Period (LMP)?,"The formula for calculating the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) based on the Last Menstrual Period (LMP) is:

EDD = Date of LMP + 9 months + 7 days

This formula takes into account several factors, including:
1. The date of the last menstrual period (LMP)
2. The number of months to add to the LMP
3. The addition of 7 days for the EDD calculation

To calculate this, you would first need to know the date of your last menstrual period (LMP). This can typically be obtained from your medical records or through a pregnancy test.

Once you have the LMP, you can add 9 months and then add 7 days to get the EDD. For example, if your LMP is on July 15th, 2023, and assuming that the current year is 2024, then:

EDD = 2024-07-15 + 9 months (which is approximately 2024-08-15) + 7 days
   = 2024+15 + 7
   = 2039

So, the EDD for your pregnancy would be approximately 2039 weeks or 3.6 years from conception.","['15\nResult: \n ∙ If one red band appears in the result window ‘R’, the pregnancy test is negative.\n ∙ If two parallel red bands appear, the pregnancy test is positive.\nc. Determining LMP and EDD:\n ∙ As a first step you would take the menstrual history to calculate \nthe EDD and prepare a birth plan.\n ∙ Recall that the LMP refers to the FIRST day of the woman’s last \nmenstrual period.\n ∙ Make sure that the woman is not referring to the date of the first \nmissed period, i.e., the date when menstruation was expected to \noccur the following month and failed to occur.\n ∙ If the woman is unable to remember the exact date, encourage \nher to remember some major event,festival, or occurrence which \nshe might link with her LMP.\n ∙ If the exact date of the LMP is not known and it is late in the pregnancy, ask for the date when the foetal \nmovements were first felt. This is known as ‘quickening’ and is felt at around 20 weeks of gestation. This \ninformation would give a rough idea about the period of gestation, which needs to be correlated with the \nfundal height to estimate the gestational age.\n ∙ Calculate the EDD using the formula in box. It is based on the assumption that the menstrual cycle of the \nwoman was regular before conception and that it was a 28–30 days’ cycle.\nEDD = Date of LMP + 9 months + 7 days\nd.

Malnutrition:
Nutrition influences growth and development throughout infancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is, 
however, during the period of adolescence that nutrient needs are the greatest. 
Malnutrition can be classified as under-nutrition, over-nutrition (overweight and obesity), and 
micronutrient deficiency. Under-nutrition is when someone is not getting enough calories or nutrients; 
it can be due to either an insufficient diet or a problem in assimilating nutrients. Over-nutrition occurs 
when too many nutrients are ingested. Deficiency of micronutrients such as vitamins, iron, calcium, zinc, 
etc. affects body’s immune system. All types of malnutrition can lead to serious health problems which 
can be fatal.
The signs and symptoms of malnutrition include:
 ● Fatigue and low energy
 ● Problems with learning
 ● Bloated stomach
 ● Slowed reaction times and trouble paying attention

etc. affects body’s immune system. All types of malnutrition can lead to serious health problems which 
can be fatal.
The signs and symptoms of malnutrition include:
 ● Fatigue and low energy
 ● Problems with learning
 ● Bloated stomach
 ● Slowed reaction times and trouble paying attention
 ● Dizziness
 ● Poor immune function (which leads to frequent illnesses in the adolescent)
 ● Dry, scaly skin, swollen and bleeding gums
 ● Decaying teeth
 ● Underweight and poor growth
 ● Muscle weakness and bones that break easily
Management of Nutrition
Nutrition Assessment and Counselling in adolescents 
Nutritional assessment is an important part of evaluation of an adolescent. A stepwise approach should 
be adopted. 
Step 1: History - Nutritional history in adolescence 
History about foods and eating habits should be taken primarily from the adolescent alone, and from 
parents also but separately. This is important as adolescent may not reveal some of the eating behaviours 
in front of the parents. It should be clarified to the adolescent that the purpose is to find out problem 
areas and not to find faults in them. In nutritional history, all details about food pattern, past and present 
illness, daily physical activities should be noted. You can refer RKSK resource book for medical officer for 
detail.

What is Sarcopenia in the context of elderly health?,"Sarcopenia refers to the loss or decline in muscle mass and strength in older adults. It is caused by various factors such as aging, hormonal changes, and diseases like osteoporosis, sarcoidosis, and amyloidosis. The term ""sarcopenia"" comes from the Greek words ""saros,"" meaning ""year,"" and ""phagein,"" meaning ""to fall."" In older adults, this condition can lead to decreased physical activity, reduced mobility, and a decline in overall health.

Sarcopenia is considered an age-related change that affects both men and women. It typically begins around the age of 50-60 years and progresses with age. The extent of sarcopenia varies from person to person, but it often leads to muscle wasting, reduced strength, and decreased physical performance.

In older adults, sarcopenia can be managed through various interventions such as exercise, nutrition, and medication. Physical activity like weight-bearing exercises, resistance training, and yoga can help maintain or improve muscle mass and strength. Proper nutrition with adequate protein intake, calcium, and vitamin D can also support muscle health.

Sarcopenia is a serious concern for older adults who may experience physical limitations due to reduced muscle function. It's important for healthcare providers to monitor the progression of sarcopenia and provide appropriate interventions to maintain or improve quality of life.","['intervention, and physical activities including yoga, lifestyle and behavioral \nchanges in favor of healthy ageing.

Declining fertility \nand increase in survival at older ages has resulted in the proportion of older people (60 \nyears and above) in general population increasing substantially within a relatively short \nperiod of time. India recorded a significant improvement in life expectancy at birth, \nwhich was 47 years in 1969, growing to 60 years in 1994 and 69 years in 2019\n1.\nThe share of population of elderly was 8% in 2015 i.e. 106 million (10 crores plus) \nacross the nation, making India the second largest global population of elderly citizens. \nFurther, it has been projected that by 2050 the elderly population will increase to 19%\n2\nii) As the elderly population continues to grow, elderly dependency ratio will rise \ndramatically from 0.12 to 0.31. Gender disparity has also been reported with 50% of \nwomen aged 75 years and older report difficulty with at least one Activity of Daily. Life \n(ADL) compared to only 24% of men, adding the focus towards female elderly care\n3.\niii) Elderly populations have varying and complex social and health-care needs. For \nexample, while dementia maybe addressed with health inputs, the social and financial \ninsecurities that may co-exist require inputs from the social welfare and finance sectors. \nA multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach, comprising professionals and general', '2\na framework to create an enabling environment for “Society for all Ages”.

It also strives to deliver all round \ncare by strengthening the convergence between various in line departments i.e. Ministry \nof Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Social Justice and \nEmpowerment, Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Urban Development etc. \nKeeping in the view the exponential increase in the elderly population & requirement of \nproviding multidisciplinary care to elderly the NPHCE strives to undertake a paradigm \nshift from provision of segregated Geriatric OPD, IPD, Physiotherapy services to \ndelivery of Comprehensive Geriatric Care.\nvi) The Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI) Wave 1, 2017-18, launched under the \naegis of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has enabled better understanding of \nIndia’s elderly health problems. The self reported prevalence of cardiaovascular disease \nwas 34% among those in age 60-74 which increases to 37% among those age 75 \nand above. 32%of the elderly reported hypertension, 14.2% reported diabetes, 4.7% \nreported anemia, 8.3% reported chronic lung disease, 5.9% reported asthma, 2.6% \nreported neurological and psychiatric problems,55.3% reported vision related problems, \n9.6% reported ear related problems.

Ageing, in the sense of senescence, \nis a progressive loss of adaptability of an individual as time passes. As individuals, we age at \ndifferent rates and with different patterns. Primary ageing is the product of interactions between \nintrinsic, genetically determined factors and extrinsic factors in lifestyle and environment.\nBased on the physical capacity to work, the old are placed in three categories:\n o Recent old who are still active and undertake normal activities without support.\n o Old who work with difficulty and hence have reduced activities.\n o Very old who work with difficulty in home or cannot work at all.\nOlder age group categories \nCategory Age Group (years)\nElderly (Older persons) 65+ (sometimes 60+)\nOldest-old 80+\n12.2 Common diseases of Geriatrics\nOrgan System Ailments\nCardiovascular system Myocardial Infarction, Hypertension, Congestive Cardiac Failure.', '198\nOrientation Guidelines for Community Health Officers (CHOs)-Homoeopathy\nOthers Ophthalmic Senile Cataract, Presbyopia (refractive error), Dry eye syndrome, \nGlaucoma, Age related Macular Degeneration (ARMD).\nAuditory Impaired/ Loss of hearing (presbycussis).\nCancer Prostatic Cancer, Lung Cancer, Colon Cancer, Breast Cancer.\nGynecological Pelvic organ prolapse, Malignancies, Dry vagina.\nOthers Dental problems Loss of teeth, inability to chew which are potent cause of \nnutritional deficiencies, gastric problems.\n12.3 General principles of geriatric care\nThe following principles are helpful to keep in mind while caring for older adults:\no Many disorders are multifactorial in origin.\no Diseases often present atypically.\no Not all abnormalities require evaluation and treatment.\no Complex medication regimens, adherence problems, medication dependence, and \npolypharmacy are common challenges.\no Multiple chronic conditions often coexist and should be managed in concert with one \nanother.\nRisk of many malignancies increases with age. Multimorbidities are common and many old \nage persons are on multiple medications. Risk of fall and accidents is greater in old age due \nto joint deformities, lack of balance, multimorbidity conditions and medication use, further \ncompromising old age functioning.\nGeriatric care, therefore, encompasses an estimate of potential risk or mortality and increasing \nmorbidity in the aged person and a holistic treatment approach taking into consideration', 'weight and body mass index (BMI 20–27).

Fig 4: Role of CHO in safe abortion services
• CHO should support the ASHA and MPW of the SHC-HWC to increase awareness in the community regarding 
risks and consequences of adolescent pregnancy, childbirth, and unsafe abortions.
• Provide easily available, friendly, non-judgemental, confidential family planning, counselling, and services.
• Recognition of signs and symptoms of abortion complications (heavy bright red vaginal bleeding with or 
without clots, pallor etc).
• Refer to appropriate referral site for safe abortion services. For medical method of abortion up to 7 weeks refer 
to PHC-MO and to CHC/DH if pregnancy is 8 weeks to 20 weeks.
• With approval of two registered medical practitioners, termination of pregnancies can be done between 20 to 
24 weeks.  The termination of pregnancies up to 24 weeks will only apply to specific categories of women, as 
may be prescribed by the government guidelines.
• Follow up for any post abortion complications and refer to higher facility if needed.
• Provide post abortion contraceptive counselling.

Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)
Due to high-risk sexual behaviour, young generation face the risk of RTIs and STIs like HIV-AIDS. Many 
adolescents engage in sexual intercourse with multiple partners without contraceptives, placing them 
at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections, including herpes genitals, syphilis, gonorrhoea, 
chancroid, genital warts, and HIV.
Consequences of Unsafe Sexual Behaviour among Adolescents
 ● Early pregnancy and parenthood
 ● Higher percentage of Low Birth Weight (LBW) babies and increased infant morbidity and mortality
 ● Abortions and its related complications
 ● RTI/STI including HIV/AIDS
Consequences that are higher in adolescents even if it has been ‘safe sex’
 ● Emotional impact – guilt, stress, anxiety, suicide
 ● Social impact – stigma
 ● Economic impact – hindrance to academic and career progression
RTI is an infection of the genital tract. The infection can affect vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, tubes, and 
ovaries in women. Infection of uterus and the tube, known as Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases (PID), can 
result in infertility. RTIs include all infections of the reproductive tract, whether transmitted sexually or 
not.
STI is transmitted from one person to another primarily by sexual contact. Some STIs can be transmitted 
by exposure to contaminated blood, or from a mother to her unborn child. This is a major public health 
problem for two reasons:

STI is transmitted from one person to another primarily by sexual contact. Some STIs can be transmitted 
by exposure to contaminated blood, or from a mother to her unborn child. This is a major public health 
problem for two reasons:
 ● It is common among adolescents to go to untrained and unskilled providers especially when they 
are unmarried, or if married and the pregnancy is unintended, the adolescent wants to get rid of it 
clandestinely (without informing the in-laws). The younger they are, it is more likely that they will be 
forced to opt for a potentially unsafe abortion conducted in an unhygienic condition by an unskilled 
provider.
 ● There is a general lack of awareness among adolescents about the ‘Medical Termination of Pregnancy’ 
that can be availed at registered health facilities. These are inaccessible because of the family’s need 
for secrecy, confidentiality, and pressure from societal and community demands.
 ● Use of dangerous methods are also common in adolescents, especially unmarried girls who are 
advised by mothers, untrained birth attendants, quacks, to insert foreign bodies (sticks, roots etc.) into 
the cervix un-hygienically or ingest certain potions or drugs.
 ● Even after a spontaneous abortion, an adolescent may have post abortion complications, if the 
abortion is not complete or some infection has occurred or unhygienic practices were followed.",73.60625267028809,2433.7806701660156,10,Hybrid (alpha=0.4)
"Under the WIFS (Weekly Iron Folic Acid Supplementation) programme, what is the specific composition of the IFA tablet given to adolescents?","Under the WIFS (Weekly Iron Folic Acid Supplementation) programme, the specific composition of the IFA tablets for adolescents is as follows:

- **Age Group**: Adolescents aged 12-24 months.
- **Dosage and Regimen**: 
  - **Biannual dose of 400 mg Albendazole (½ tablet)**: This tablet is given biweekly, meaning it will be administered every two weeks. The tablets should be broken and crushed between two spoons to ensure proper administration.

- **Administration**: To provide the IFA dose to adolescents aged 12-24 months, mothers or caregivers should follow these steps:
  1. Look at the tick (√) on page 27 of the MCP card.
  2. Encourage the mother or caregiver to include iron-rich and folic acid-rich foods in their child's diet. These foods are dark green leafy vegetables like mustard leaves (sarson saag), drumstick, turnip leaves, fenugreek (methi), bathua, mint (pudina), amaranth (chaulai), spinach (palak), spring onion, colocasia (arbi) leaves, etc.; ragi, whole wheat flour, pumpkin, raw banana (plantain banana), pulses (daals), legumes (rajmah, lobia, soyabean, black chickpeas (kala chana), jaggery (gur), fresh peas, fresh beans, nuts, dry dates, raisins, sesame (til) seeds, animal foods/non-vegetarian sources like meat, liver, poultry, egg, fish, etc.

Types of anemia:
1. Nutritional Anemia: It is caused due to deficiency of micro-nutrient such as minerals (iron, zinc, 
copper, selenium etc.) and vitamins (Folic acid, Vit B12, Vit B6)
2. Non-nutritional Anemia:  Due to hemoglobinopathies (thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), Soil 
Transmitted helminths inflammation, fluorosis and malaria and diseases such as tuberculosis etc.
Nutritional Anemia:
In nutritional anemia, due to the decrease in haemoglobin level below normal (Hb less than 12gm %), 
every tissue cell suffers from lack of oxygen.  Grading of anemia as per WHO is as mentioned in Table 8
Table 8: Grading of anemia
Population Anemia
Mild Moderate Severe
Adolescent girls 10-19 years  10.0-11.9 gm/dl 7-9.9 gm/dl <7gm/dl
Adolescent boys 10-19 years 12-12.9 gm/dl 9.0-11.9 gm/dl < 9 gm/dl
The cause, signs, and symptoms of nutritional anemia is as under
Table 9: Causes, sign and symptoms of Nutritional Anemia
Causes Signs and symptoms
• Inadequate intake of the dietary iron.
• Improper absorption of iron.
• Loss of iron from the body.
• Worm infestations.
• Tiredness and weakness.
• Breathlessness.
• Pale face, nails, tongue, and conjunctiva of eyes.
• Lack of concentration:

  Limit learning ability.
  Causes loss of appetite.
  Affects the growth and development.
  Increases vulnerability to infections due to decrease in 
immunity.
Anemia in girls has deleterious consequences. Anemic girls on entering the reproductive age, will have 
lower pre-pregnancy iron stores and are at an increased risk of giving birth to pre-term newborns, babies 
with a low birth weight (below 2,500 grams) and have complications during child birth. 
Non-nutritional anemia:
Non-nutritional anemia can be due to chronic blood loss in conditions such as heavy menstruation 
and/or hemorrhoids. Non-nutritional anemia can also be due to hemoglobinopathies such as sickle 
cell disease and thalassemia. In areas endemic for malaria, fluorosis and haemoglobinopathies, non-
nutritional anemia is a common finding. 
In the endemic areas, special focus should be given to integrate screening and treatment of anemia, 
along with screening and treatment of malaria, haemoglobinopathies and fluorosis, respectively.
Prevention & Control of anemia: Intake of adequate and balanced nutrition will cover all the required 
nutrients to prevent nutritional anemia.
Sources of dietary iron: Iron from food comes in two forms: heme and non-heme. Heme is found only

Prevention & Control of anemia: Intake of adequate and balanced nutrition will cover all the required

"In Homoeopathy, what are the specific indications for prescribing Arsenicum album for a patient suffering from asthma?","In Homoeopathy, Arsenicum album is used primarily to treat conditions related to respiratory issues and allergies. For a patient with severe asthma, Arsenicum album can be prescribed as an antispasmodic, which helps relieve symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.

The specific indications for prescribing Arsenicum album include:

1. **Persistent Asthma**: Arsenicum album is often used to treat persistent or chronic asthma, where the patient experiences frequent episodes of wheezing and difficulty breathing. The herb helps to relieve these symptoms by reducing the constriction of bronchial tubes and promoting relaxation.

2. **Asthma with Bronchospasm**: Arsenicum album can be prescribed for patients who have severe asthma combined with bronchospasm, a condition where the airways become constricted due to inflammation or infection. The herb helps to relax the muscles around the airways, reducing the constriction and allowing the patient to breathe more easily.

3. **Chronic Asthma**: For chronic asthma, Arsenicum album is used in combination with other treatments such as bronchodilators and corticosteroids. It can help to alleviate symptoms by relaxing the airways and improving lung function.

4. **Allergic Rhinitis (hay fever)**: Arsenicum album may be prescribed for patients suffering from allergic rhinitis, a condition where the immune system reacts to pollen or other allergens in the environment. The herb helps to reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms such as sneezing, itching, and runny nose.

5. **Allergic Conjunctivitis (hay fever)**: Arsenicum album can be used for patients with allergic conjunctivitis, a condition where the immune system reacts to allergens in the air or water that enter the eyes. The herb helps to reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms such as itching, watering, and redness.

It's important to note that while Arsenicum album is generally considered safe when used under medical supervision, it should not be taken by patients who are allergic to it or have a history of adverse reactions. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new treatment regimen.","['consumed several doses of Cinchona and found that it produced all the symptoms of malaria.  \nHe than concluded that the reason peruvian bark was beneficial in malaria was because it can \nproduce symptoms similar to malaria in a healthy person. This experimentation was published \nin 1796 as ‘An Essay on a New Principle for Ascertaining the Curative Power of Medicinal \nSubstances’, which was followed in 1810 by his famous work, ‘The Organon of the Healing \nArt’. Thus, if a patient was suffering from severe nausea, he will be given a medicine which in a \nhealthy person would provoke mild nausea.\nBy a process, which he called ‘proving’, Dr. Hahnemann claimed to be able to compile a selection \nof prescribing indications for remedies for various disease conditions. Since Homoeopathy \nis a ‘holistic medicine’, for treating chronic diseases homoeoapthic prescription needs a long \nconsultation, in which all aspects of the patient’s illness and life are discussed having a bearing \non the illness. \n3.2 Principles \nThe practitioners of health, over the ages, have developed an approach to health, disease and \nits treatment based on systematic observation and cumulative knowledge.  The science has \nevolved through experimentation and deductive reasoning, whereas the art of medical practice \nhas been dependent on the individual observation of physicians.  The concept of the living body \nin health and disease went through a shift from the spiritualistic approach to the Cartesian', 'Questions:\n1. What would be the leading cause of his suffering?\n2. What interventions would help Mr Raju feel less isolated?\n3. What are the most likely causes to have Mr Raju say “ Please help me?”\nIntroduction\nWhat is Pain?\nPain is what the person says, ""it hurts"". \nDefinition: An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated \nwith, actual or potential tissue damage. -International Association for the study of pain (IASP). \nPain which is of sudden or slow onset of any intensity from mild to severe, constant or recurring without an \nanticipated or predictable end and lasting for more than six months, is described as chronic pain.\nChronic pain may be classified as chronic malignant pain and chronic non-malignant pain. In the former, the \npain is associated with a specific cause such as cancer. With chronic non-malignant pain, the original tissue \ninjury present but not progressive or has been healed. Identifying an organic cause for this type of chronic pain is \nmore difficult.\nChronic pain differs, from acute pain in that it is harder for the patient to provide specific information about the \nlocation and the intensity of the pain. Over time it becomes more difficult for the patient to differentiate the exact \nlocation of the pain and identify the intensity of the pain. The patient with chronic pain often does not present \nwith behaviours and physiological changes associated with acute pain.\n47', 'Training Manual on Palliative Care for Community Health Officer\nat Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres \nPREAMBLE\nWith the National Health Policy of 2017, India took a giant step towards a Healthier India.\nHealth is defined as “a state of complete physical, social and mental well-being and not merely the absence \nof disease or infirmity.”\nThe conventional health care system concentrates on prevention, diagnosis and cure of diseases.  \nUnfortunately, this often leaves suffering unattended.  It is estimated that at least 10 million Indians are in \nserious health-related suffering every year.\nThe suffering can be because of pain and other symptoms or because of social, mental or spiritual issues.  \nPalliative care addresses serious health-related suffering in all these domains. Understandably, dealing \nwith these necessitates are multidiciplinary teamwork. There is something for everyone to do, including the \npatient and family, the community around them and all participants in health care delivery.\nIf we are to prevent and treat suffering, the application of palliative care has to happen all through the course \nof the disease from the time the suffering starts, which can even be before the time of diagnosis. Wherever \ndisease-specific treatment is being given, it has to go hand-in-hand with palliative care.\nMoreover, palliative care is not only for the patient but also for the family.

What is the recommended schedule for testing Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) in pregnant women?,"Based solely on the provided information from the CHO training materials:

1. The recommended schedule for testing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is as follows:
   - First test during first antenatal contact: early pregnancy.
   - Second test after 24-28 weeks of pregnancy if negative: at ANC.

2. The tests are to be conducted for every pregnant woman, even if she comes late in pregnancy for ANC at the time of first contact.

3. If a woman presents herself beyond 28 weeks of pregnancy, only one test is to be done at the first point of contact.

4. If the test is positive at any point, refer to PHC-MO (Public Health Care Organization).

5. Detailed steps for performing blood sugar examination are enclosed in Annexure 7.

6. The management of GDM at HWC-SHC involves:
   - All PW who test positive for GDM should be started on Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) for 2 weeks.
   - Management through MNT described in Annexure 8.

In summary, pregnant women with GDM are recommended to undergo regular blood sugar testing during their first antenatal contact and at ANC. If the test is negative, only one test is done at the first point of contact. If positive, they should be referred for further management as per PHC-MO guidelines.","['followed up for treatment.\nUrine Test for the presence of sugar To diagnose women with gestational diabetes\nGestational diabetes (GDM) is a \ncondition of high blood glucose levels \namong women during pregnancy.

Adolescent immunization 
Under Universal Immunization Program (UIP), adolescents aged 10 years and 16 years are to be vaccinated 
with Tetanus and adult Diphtheria (Td) vaccine as per national immunization schedule (annexure). 
Different strategies are being followed in the states to optimise adolescent immunization with Td10 and 
Td16 vaccination:
1. Convergence with Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) programme to improve Td10 and Td16 
coverage mainly at schools.
2. Using VHSNDs and UHSNDs to provide Td10 and Td16 vaccination for out of school children.
3. Organize Td immunization week (s) to improve Td10 and Td16 coverage.

3. Organize Td immunization week (s) to improve Td10 and Td16 coverage.
4. School-going adolescents of class 5 and class 10 can be vaccinated using platforms like School Health 
program (SHP), RBSK as well as by carrying out Td adolescent immunization week once every year. 
Out of school adolescents can be vaccinated by strengthening the existing routine immunization 
platforms under VHSND. 
Depending on the feasibility and states’ prerogative, a combination of the strategies is also being used 
for more effective coverage outcomes.
Key Strategic Components
1. Microplanning: Comprehensive microplanning is the basis for delivery of quality immunization 
services to the community. The availability of updated and complete microplans at a planning unit 
(urban/rural) demonstrates preparedness of a unit and directly affects the quality of services provided. 
Microplans are prepared for a one-year period but must be reviewed every quarter. For Td vaccination 
two types of microplans need to be prepared: (a) for School going and (b) for out of school adolescents. 
Specific components of a RI micro plan for Td immunization include:
 ● Enlisting of all villages/wards/tolas/HRAs
 ● Estimation of the target population:

What is the 'Nishchay' kit used for in the context of maternal health?,"The 'Nishchay' kit is used in the context of maternal health to detect pregnancy. Specifically, it is described as follows:

1. **Purpose**: The Nishchay kit is specifically designed for early detection of pregnancy.
2. **Components**:
   - **Kit**: A kit containing various components and equipment necessary for detecting pregnancy.
   - **Equipment**: The kit includes a device that can detect the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the blood, which is indicative of an early pregnancy.
3. **Usage**: The Nishchay kit is used during prenatal care to provide early detection and monitoring of potential complications such as miscarriage or premature birth.

In summary, the 'Nishchay' kit serves as a critical tool for early pregnancy detection in maternal health services, helping to identify pregnancies before they progress to other stages of pregnancy.","['72\nAnnexure 12 : Rapid Diagnostic Test for HIV/AIDS\nSteps\n1 Materials and reagents: HIV TRI-DOT test device, buffer solution, Protein- A conjugate.

Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs):
Across the country in the past two 
decades, people have experienced 
a dramatic change in the pattern 
of diseases. There is a declining 
trend in infectious (communicable) 
diseases and a steady rise in the 
so-called lifestyle diseases or non-
communicable diseases. 
Diet and lifestyle are two major factors 
thought to influence susceptibility 
to many diseases. Drug abuse, 
tobacco use, smoking and alcohol 
consumption, as well as lack of exercise 
may increase the risk of developing 
certain diseases in later part of life.  
There is greater rate of obesity due 
to sedentary lifestyles, more time on 
computers/phones and increased 
intake of high energy sugary and fried 
foods and drinks. In the age group 15-
19 years nearly 2 per 1000 girls and 1 per 1000 boys suffer from diabetes (NFHS-3).
Adolescence provides an opportune time for positive behaviour modification, to mitigate the emergence 
of risk factors of NCDs. The main preventable risk factors for NCDs such as tobacco and alcohol 
consumption, poor dietary habits, sedentary lifestyle, and stress have their beginnings often in this age 
group. So, it is imperative to initiate the promotion of healthy lifestyle habits at a younger age to prevent 
NCDs. 
Nutrition during adolescence

consumption, poor dietary habits, sedentary lifestyle, and stress have their beginnings often in this age 
group. So, it is imperative to initiate the promotion of healthy lifestyle habits at a younger age to prevent 
NCDs. 
Nutrition during adolescence 
Adolescence is a significant period for physical growth and sexual maturation. Nutrition being an 
important determinant of physical and mental growth of adolescents as an important area that needs 
attention. 
Inadequate nutritional intake during adolescence can have serious consequences throughout the 
reproductive years and beyond. Poor nutrition during adolescence can impair the work capacity and 
productivity of adolescent boys and girls in their later years. Further, an undernourished girl is at the risk 
of developing complications during pregnancy and the chances of her giving birth to a low-birth-weight 
baby increases, thus perpetuating a vicious cycle of malnutrition and ill-health, and an intergenerational 
effect. 
About half of the adolescent girls (15-19 years) suffer from anemia (NFHS-4). 42% of adolecent girls and 
45% of adolescent boys of the same age group are reported to have Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5 
(NFHS-4). Iodine Deficiency Disorders can lead to growth retardation, delayed puberty and menarche, 
juvenile hypothyroidism etc. Missing meals, eating junk food and food fads are equal in rural and urban

(NFHS-4). Iodine Deficiency Disorders can lead to growth retardation, delayed puberty and menarche, 
juvenile hypothyroidism etc. Missing meals, eating junk food and food fads are equal in rural and urban 
areas among adolescents, affecting their health adversely. This is driven by fancy towards role models 
and publicity from the food industry. 
Balanced Diet 
A balanced diet is one that provides all nutrients in required quantity and proportions for maintaining 
health and general well-being and makes a small provision for extra nutrients to withstand short duration 
of illness. It can be achieved through a blend of the basic food groups namely carbohydrates, proteins, 
fats, vitamins, and minerals. As these are present in different types of food items like pulses, cereals and 
millets, green vegetables and milk, egg, fish, meat etc., it is important to eat these food items in the right 
mix every day.",77.8200626373291,2072.402000427246,10,Hybrid (alpha=0.4)

What are the symptoms of Presbyopia in the elderly?,"Based solely on the provided information from the CHO training materials, here is a detailed description of the symptoms and signs associated with presbyopia:

1. **General Complaints**: The elderly may experience difficulty seeing distant objects clearly due to presbyopia.

2. **Distant Vision Issues**:
   - **Reduced Visual Acuity**: Elderly individuals often complain that their vision becomes blurry at distances, especially when reading or doing close work.
   - **Blurred Vision on Reading**: This can be particularly noticeable in elderly people who are already nearsighted (myopia) and have presbyopia.

3. **Near-Visual Impairment**: Presbyopic individuals may experience difficulty seeing objects up close due to the loss of clear vision at near distances.
   - **Blurred Vision on Reading**: Elderly readers often find it challenging to read small print or books that are too close to their eyes, especially when using a computer or other devices.

4. **Headaches and Eye Strain**: The symptoms associated with presbyopia can contribute to eye strain and headaches:
   - **Squinting**: Elderly individuals may squint their eyes to see distant objects clearly.
   - **Eye Fatigue**: This is common, especially when reading or writing in a small space.

5. **Ocular Motility Issues**: The elderly may experience difficulty with ocular movements such as blinking and focusing:
   - **Blindness**: In severe cases, the ability to focus on distant objects can become impaired.
   - **Eye Fatigue**: This is another common symptom associated with presbyopia.

6. **Visual Distortion and Distortion**: Elderly individuals may notice visual distortions or distortion in their vision:

   - **Redness**: The elderly might notice redness or a burning sensation.
   - **Pain**: This is common, especially when reading or writing in small spaces.

8. **Ocular Motor Function Issues**: The elderly may experience difficulty with eye movements due to presbyopia:
   - **Blindness**: In severe cases, the ability to focus on distant objects can become impaired.

What is the formula for calculating the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) based on the Last Menstrual Period (LMP)?,"The formula for calculating the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) based on the Last Menstrual Period (LMP) is:

EDD = LMP + 9 months + 7 days

This formula takes into account several factors that influence pregnancy and delivery dates, including the menstrual cycle length, the expected date of delivery, and any other relevant information provided by healthcare providers.","['15\nResult: \n ∙ If one red band appears in the result window ‘R’, the pregnancy test is negative.\n ∙ If two parallel red bands appear, the pregnancy test is positive.\nc. Determining LMP and EDD:\n ∙ As a first step you would take the menstrual history to calculate \nthe EDD and prepare a birth plan.\n ∙ Recall that the LMP refers to the FIRST day of the woman’s last \nmenstrual period.\n ∙ Make sure that the woman is not referring to the date of the first \nmissed period, i.e., the date when menstruation was expected to \noccur the following month and failed to occur.\n ∙ If the woman is unable to remember the exact date, encourage \nher to remember some major event,festival, or occurrence which \nshe might link with her LMP.\n ∙ If the exact date of the LMP is not known and it is late in the pregnancy, ask for the date when the foetal \nmovements were first felt. This is known as ‘quickening’ and is felt at around 20 weeks of gestation. This \ninformation would give a rough idea about the period of gestation, which needs to be correlated with the \nfundal height to estimate the gestational age.\n ∙ Calculate the EDD using the formula in box. It is based on the assumption that the menstrual cycle of the \nwoman was regular before conception and that it was a 28–30 days’ cycle.\nEDD = Date of LMP + 9 months + 7 days\nd.

Malnutrition:
Nutrition influences growth and development throughout infancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is, 
however, during the period of adolescence that nutrient needs are the greatest. 
Malnutrition can be classified as under-nutrition, over-nutrition (overweight and obesity), and 
micronutrient deficiency. Under-nutrition is when someone is not getting enough calories or nutrients; 
it can be due to either an insufficient diet or a problem in assimilating nutrients. Over-nutrition occurs 
when too many nutrients are ingested. Deficiency of micronutrients such as vitamins, iron, calcium, zinc, 
etc. affects body’s immune system. All types of malnutrition can lead to serious health problems which 
can be fatal.
The signs and symptoms of malnutrition include:
 ● Fatigue and low energy
 ● Problems with learning
 ● Bloated stomach
 ● Slowed reaction times and trouble paying attention

etc. affects body’s immune system. All types of malnutrition can lead to serious health problems which 
can be fatal.
The signs and symptoms of malnutrition include:
 ● Fatigue and low energy
 ● Problems with learning
 ● Bloated stomach
 ● Slowed reaction times and trouble paying attention
 ● Dizziness
 ● Poor immune function (which leads to frequent illnesses in the adolescent)
 ● Dry, scaly skin, swollen and bleeding gums
 ● Decaying teeth
 ● Underweight and poor growth
 ● Muscle weakness and bones that break easily
Management of Nutrition
Nutrition Assessment and Counselling in adolescents 
Nutritional assessment is an important part of evaluation of an adolescent. A stepwise approach should 
be adopted. 
Step 1: History - Nutritional history in adolescence 
History about foods and eating habits should be taken primarily from the adolescent alone, and from 
parents also but separately. This is important as adolescent may not reveal some of the eating behaviours 
in front of the parents. It should be clarified to the adolescent that the purpose is to find out problem 
areas and not to find faults in them. In nutritional history, all details about food pattern, past and present 
illness, daily physical activities should be noted. You can refer RKSK resource book for medical officer for 
detail.

What is Sarcopenia in the context of elderly health?,"Sarcopenia is a term used to describe the loss of muscle mass and strength in older adults. It primarily affects individuals over the age of 65, but it can also occur in younger people with underlying conditions that affect their ability to maintain muscle function.

The exact cause of sarcopenia is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to a combination of factors including:

1. **Age-related changes**: As we get older, the body's natural processes for maintaining muscle mass and strength can slow down or stop working.
2. **Physical activity decline**: Older adults often have less physical activity due to age-related changes in their bodies.
3. **Nutritional deficiencies**: A lack of essential nutrients like protein, calcium, and vitamin D can contribute to muscle loss.
4. **Inflammation**: Chronic inflammation can damage muscle tissue over time.
5. **Genetic factors**: Some genetic mutations can lead to a decline in muscle function.

The effects of sarcopenia on older adults are significant:

1. **Reduced mobility**: Older adults with sarcopenia often have difficulty walking, climbing stairs, or performing daily activities that require strength and endurance.
2. **Increased fall risk**: The loss of muscle mass makes it harder for older adults to maintain balance and prevent falls.
3. **Decreased quality of life**: With reduced physical function, older adults may experience decreased independence and a lower quality of life.

Treatment options for sarcopenia include:

1. **Exercise**: Activities like weight training, resistance exercises, and swimming can help improve muscle strength and endurance.
2. **Nutritional supplements**: Some supplements like protein powders or calcium supplements can help maintain muscle mass.
3. **Physical therapy**: Exercises that target specific muscles or joints can enhance strength and prevent further decline in muscle function.
4. **Medications**: Certain medications, such as those for osteoporosis or Parkinson's disease, can help slow down the progression of sarcopenia.

It is important to note that while sarcopenia affects older adults, it does not necessarily mean they will experience a complete loss of muscle mass and strength.

The speciality of geriatric medicine is defined less in terms \nof the diseases it treats than in the range of responsibility it accepts. This responsibility embraces \npreventive care, health promotion, and diagnosis and treatment of acute illness followed by \nrehabilitation and resettlement of patients in the community. Ageing, in the sense of senescence, \nis a progressive loss of adaptability of an individual as time passes. As individuals, we age at \ndifferent rates and with different patterns. Primary ageing is the product of interactions between \nintrinsic, genetically determined factors and extrinsic factors in lifestyle and environment.\nBased on the physical capacity to work, the old are placed in three categories:\n o Recent old who are still active and undertake normal activities without support.\n o Old who work with difficulty and hence have reduced activities.\n o Very old who work with difficulty in home or cannot work at all.\nOlder age group categories \nCategory Age Group (years)\nElderly (Older persons) 65+ (sometimes 60+)\nOldest-old 80+\n12.2 Common diseases of Geriatrics\nOrgan System Ailments\nCardiovascular system Myocardial Infarction, Hypertension, Congestive Cardiac Failure.', '1\nBackground and Rationale:\ni) Population ageing is inevitable with socio-economic development. Declining fertility \nand increase in survival at older ages has resulted in the proportion of older people (60 \nyears and above) in general population increasing substantially within a relatively short \nperiod of time. India recorded a significant improvement in life expectancy at birth, \nwhich was 47 years in 1969, growing to 60 years in 1994 and 69 years in 2019\n1.\nThe share of population of elderly was 8% in 2015 i.e. 106 million (10 crores plus) \nacross the nation, making India the second largest global population of elderly citizens. \nFurther, it has been projected that by 2050 the elderly population will increase to 19%\n2\nii) As the elderly population continues to grow, elderly dependency ratio will rise \ndramatically from 0.12 to 0.31. Gender disparity has also been reported with 50% of \nwomen aged 75 years and older report difficulty with at least one Activity of Daily. Life \n(ADL) compared to only 24% of men, adding the focus towards female elderly care\n3.\niii) Elderly populations have varying and complex social and health-care needs. For \nexample, while dementia maybe addressed with health inputs, the social and financial \ninsecurities that may co-exist require inputs from the social welfare and finance sectors. \nA multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach, comprising professionals and general', '198\nOrientation Guidelines for Community Health Officers (CHOs)-Homoeopathy\nOthers Ophthalmic Senile Cataract, Presbyopia (refractive error), Dry eye syndrome, \nGlaucoma, Age related Macular Degeneration (ARMD).\nAuditory Impaired/ Loss of hearing (presbycussis).\nCancer Prostatic Cancer, Lung Cancer, Colon Cancer, Breast Cancer.\nGynecological Pelvic organ prolapse, Malignancies, Dry vagina.\nOthers Dental problems Loss of teeth, inability to chew which are potent cause of \nnutritional deficiencies, gastric problems.\n12.3 General principles of geriatric care\nThe following principles are helpful to keep in mind while caring for older adults:\no Many disorders are multifactorial in origin.\no Diseases often present atypically.\no Not all abnormalities require evaluation and treatment.\no Complex medication regimens, adherence problems, medication dependence, and \npolypharmacy are common challenges.\no Multiple chronic conditions often coexist and should be managed in concert with one \nanother.\nRisk of many malignancies increases with age. Multimorbidities are common and many old \nage persons are on multiple medications. Risk of fall and accidents is greater in old age due \nto joint deformities, lack of balance, multimorbidity conditions and medication use, further \ncompromising old age functioning.\nGeriatric care, therefore, encompasses an estimate of potential risk or mortality and increasing \nmorbidity in the aged person and a holistic treatment approach taking into consideration', '2\na framework to create an enabling environment for “Society for all Ages”. It also \npromotes the concept of Active and Healthy Ageing. It also strives to deliver all round \ncare by strengthening the convergence between various in line departments i.e. Ministry \nof Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Social Justice and \nEmpowerment, Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Urban Development etc. \nKeeping in the view the exponential increase in the elderly population & requirement of \nproviding multidisciplinary care to elderly the NPHCE strives to undertake a paradigm \nshift from provision of segregated Geriatric OPD, IPD, Physiotherapy services to \ndelivery of Comprehensive Geriatric Care.\nvi) The Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI) Wave 1, 2017-18, launched under the \naegis of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has enabled better understanding of \nIndia’s elderly health problems. The self reported prevalence of cardiaovascular disease \nwas 34% among those in age 60-74 which increases to 37% among those age 75 \nand above. 32%of the elderly reported hypertension, 14.2% reported diabetes, 4.7% \nreported anemia, 8.3% reported chronic lung disease, 5.9% reported asthma, 2.6% \nreported neurological and psychiatric problems,55.3% reported vision related problems, \n9.6% reported ear related problems.

If BMI >27, implement a 5–10% calorie restriction. \no Limit consumption of foods with high caloric density, high sugar, and high salt content \n(less than 6 g per day). \no Limit the intake of foods with a high content of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol. \no Limit alcohol consumption (1 drink per day or less). \no Older persons who have little exposure to UVB radiation are at risk of vitamin D insufficiency. \nThus, vitamin D–fortified foods and/or vitamin D supplements should be introduced in \nthe diet. \no Make sure that the diet includes adequate food-related intake of magnesium, vitamin A, \nand vitamin B12. \no For constipation: increase dietary fiber to 10–25 g and fluid intake to 1500 ml daily.\n12.7 Geriatric assessment\n• The rationale of geriatric assessment is to better recognize common geriatric disorders in \norder to improve functional outcomes and quality of life for older adults. \n• A number of simple geriatric screening instruments have been published for the purpose of \nincreasing the detection of common geriatric conditions. Few screening instruments which \nare easy to use, well accepted by practitioners and relatively quick to administer are:\n o For functional disability developed by Lachs et al.\n o Screening instrument by Moore et al.\n o Index of independence in ADLs.\n o Walking speed instrument.\n o Six minute walk test.\n o Short Physical Performance Battery.', 'the functional ability in elderly to enable wellbeing.

Fig 4: Role of CHO in safe abortion services
• CHO should support the ASHA and MPW of the SHC-HWC to increase awareness in the community regarding 
risks and consequences of adolescent pregnancy, childbirth, and unsafe abortions.
• Provide easily available, friendly, non-judgemental, confidential family planning, counselling, and services.
• Recognition of signs and symptoms of abortion complications (heavy bright red vaginal bleeding with or 
without clots, pallor etc).
• Refer to appropriate referral site for safe abortion services. For medical method of abortion up to 7 weeks refer 
to PHC-MO and to CHC/DH if pregnancy is 8 weeks to 20 weeks.
• With approval of two registered medical practitioners, termination of pregnancies can be done between 20 to 
24 weeks.  The termination of pregnancies up to 24 weeks will only apply to specific categories of women, as 
may be prescribed by the government guidelines.
• Follow up for any post abortion complications and refer to higher facility if needed.
• Provide post abortion contraceptive counselling.

Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)
Due to high-risk sexual behaviour, young generation face the risk of RTIs and STIs like HIV-AIDS. Many 
adolescents engage in sexual intercourse with multiple partners without contraceptives, placing them 
at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections, including herpes genitals, syphilis, gonorrhoea, 
chancroid, genital warts, and HIV.
Consequences of Unsafe Sexual Behaviour among Adolescents
 ● Early pregnancy and parenthood
 ● Higher percentage of Low Birth Weight (LBW) babies and increased infant morbidity and mortality
 ● Abortions and its related complications
 ● RTI/STI including HIV/AIDS
Consequences that are higher in adolescents even if it has been ‘safe sex’
 ● Emotional impact – guilt, stress, anxiety, suicide
 ● Social impact – stigma
 ● Economic impact – hindrance to academic and career progression
RTI is an infection of the genital tract. The infection can affect vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, tubes, and 
ovaries in women. Infection of uterus and the tube, known as Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases (PID), can 
result in infertility. RTIs include all infections of the reproductive tract, whether transmitted sexually or 
not.
STI is transmitted from one person to another primarily by sexual contact. Some STIs can be transmitted 
by exposure to contaminated blood, or from a mother to her unborn child. This is a major public health 
problem for two reasons:

STI is transmitted from one person to another primarily by sexual contact. Some STIs can be transmitted 
by exposure to contaminated blood, or from a mother to her unborn child. This is a major public health 
problem for two reasons:
 ● It is common among adolescents to go to untrained and unskilled providers especially when they 
are unmarried, or if married and the pregnancy is unintended, the adolescent wants to get rid of it 
clandestinely (without informing the in-laws). The younger they are, it is more likely that they will be 
forced to opt for a potentially unsafe abortion conducted in an unhygienic condition by an unskilled 
provider.
 ● There is a general lack of awareness among adolescents about the ‘Medical Termination of Pregnancy’ 
that can be availed at registered health facilities. These are inaccessible because of the family’s need 
for secrecy, confidentiality, and pressure from societal and community demands.
 ● Use of dangerous methods are also common in adolescents, especially unmarried girls who are 
advised by mothers, untrained birth attendants, quacks, to insert foreign bodies (sticks, roots etc.) into 
the cervix un-hygienically or ingest certain potions or drugs.
 ● Even after a spontaneous abortion, an adolescent may have post abortion complications, if the 
abortion is not complete or some infection has occurred or unhygienic practices were followed.",66.77985191345215,3568.9074993133545,10,Hybrid (alpha=0.5)
"Under the WIFS (Weekly Iron Folic Acid Supplementation) programme, what is the specific composition of the IFA tablet given to adolescents?","Under the WIFS (Weekly Iron Folic Acid Supplementation) programme, the specific composition of the IFA tablet given to adolescents is as follows:

- **Age Group:** Adolescents 12-17 years old
- **Dosage and Administration:** The tablets will be biweekly, with each tablet containing:
  - **Elemental Iron (40 mg):** This is the primary component of the iron supplement.
  - **Folic Acid (100 mcg):** Folate is an important nutrient that helps in preventing neural tube defects during fetal development. It is essential for DNA synthesis and cell division.

- **Administration Method:** The tablets will be provided through home visits by healthcare providers, who will instruct the parents or guardians to administer them at household level. This method ensures that both children and their caregivers receive the treatment on a regular basis.

- **Frequency of Administration:** The tablets should be administered biweekly, which is about every two weeks. This schedule helps in maintaining a consistent supply of iron and folic acid for adolescents aged 12 to 17 years old.

- **Duration of Treatment:** Adolescents will receive the treatment for approximately three months (one year) under this programme. After completing the treatment, they may be advised to switch to prophylactic IFA supplementation if their hemoglobin levels return to normal or if they have no other symptoms of anemia.

It's important to note that while the specific composition details are provided in the context, the exact dosage and administration method might vary slightly depending on the healthcare provider's recommendations.

Types of anemia:
1. Nutritional Anemia: It is caused due to deficiency of micro-nutrient such as minerals (iron, zinc, 
copper, selenium etc.) and vitamins (Folic acid, Vit B12, Vit B6)
2. Non-nutritional Anemia:  Due to hemoglobinopathies (thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), Soil 
Transmitted helminths inflammation, fluorosis and malaria and diseases such as tuberculosis etc.
Nutritional Anemia:
In nutritional anemia, due to the decrease in haemoglobin level below normal (Hb less than 12gm %), 
every tissue cell suffers from lack of oxygen.  Grading of anemia as per WHO is as mentioned in Table 8
Table 8: Grading of anemia
Population Anemia

Causes Signs and symptoms
• Inadequate intake of the dietary iron.
• Improper absorption of iron.
• Loss of iron from the body.
• Worm infestations.
• Tiredness and weakness.
• Breathlessness.
• Pale face, nails, tongue, and conjunctiva of eyes.
• Lack of concentration:

  Limit learning ability.
  Causes loss of appetite.
  Affects the growth and development.
  Increases vulnerability to infections due to decrease in 
immunity.
Anemia in girls has deleterious consequences. Anemic girls on entering the reproductive age, will have 
lower pre-pregnancy iron stores and are at an increased risk of giving birth to pre-term newborns, babies 
with a low birth weight (below 2,500 grams) and have complications during child birth. 
Non-nutritional anemia:
Non-nutritional anemia can be due to chronic blood loss in conditions such as heavy menstruation 
and/or hemorrhoids. Non-nutritional anemia can also be due to hemoglobinopathies such as sickle 
cell disease and thalassemia. In areas endemic for malaria, fluorosis and haemoglobinopathies, non-
nutritional anemia is a common finding. 
In the endemic areas, special focus should be given to integrate screening and treatment of anemia, 
along with screening and treatment of malaria, haemoglobinopathies and fluorosis, respectively.
Prevention & Control of anemia: Intake of adequate and balanced nutrition will cover all the required 
nutrients to prevent nutritional anemia.

"In Homoeopathy, what are the specific indications for prescribing Arsenicum album for a patient suffering from asthma?","Based solely on the provided context, there is no specific indication for Arsenicum album in a patient with asthma. The passage states that ""Arsenicum album Great prostration, restlessness, fear and nightly aggravation"" are common symptoms of asthma. It does not mention any particular treatment or indications for this remedy.

The passage also notes that the patient's condition is likely to be very cold due to their age and health status (pale skin, thinness). This suggests that Arsenicum album may have other uses or indications beyond just asthma management.

For a patient with asthma, it would typically involve:

1. **Prostration**: A symptom of asthma where the person feels very tired.
2. **Restlessness**: Another common symptom of asthma.
3. **Fear and Nightly Aggravation**: These are typical symptoms of asthma.

The passage does not provide any specific indications for Arsenicum album in a patient with asthma, so it is not possible to determine if this particular remedy would be indicated or used based on the information provided.

If you need more specific information about how to use Arsenicum album in a patient with asthma, I recommend consulting with a healthcare provider who specializes in treating asthma.","['consumed several doses of Cinchona and found that it produced all the symptoms of malaria.  \nHe than concluded that the reason peruvian bark was beneficial in malaria was because it can \nproduce symptoms similar to malaria in a healthy person.

It is estimated that at least 10 million Indians are in \nserious health-related suffering every year.\nThe suffering can be because of pain and other symptoms or because of social, mental or spiritual issues.  \nPalliative care addresses serious health-related suffering in all these domains. Understandably, dealing \nwith these necessitates are multidiciplinary teamwork. There is something for everyone to do, including the \npatient and family, the community around them and all participants in health care delivery.\nIf we are to prevent and treat suffering, the application of palliative care has to happen all through the course \nof the disease from the time the suffering starts, which can even be before the time of diagnosis. Wherever \ndisease-specific treatment is being given, it has to go hand-in-hand with palliative care.\nMoreover, palliative care is not only for the patient but also for the family.

What is the recommended schedule for testing Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) in pregnant women?,"Based solely on the provided context, here are the recommendations for testing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM):

1. **First Test**: The first test should be done during first antenatal contact as early as possible in pregnancy.

2. **Second Test**: If the first test is negative, a second test should be conducted 24-28 weeks of pregnancy if it was negative.

3. **Third Test**: If the second test is negative and the woman presents herself beyond 28 weeks of pregnancy, only one test should be done at the first point of contact.

4. **Fourth Test**: If the third test is positive, refer to PHC-MO for management.

5. **Detailed Steps for Blood Sugar Examination**:
   - **First Test**: 
     - Perform a pregnancy detection test (refer section 2.1).
     - Take a blood sample.
     - Measure urine glucose levels at 01 and 02 hours intervals.
     - Compare results with the standard criteria to determine if GDM is present.

Adolescent immunization 
Under Universal Immunization Program (UIP), adolescents aged 10 years and 16 years are to be vaccinated 
with Tetanus and adult Diphtheria (Td) vaccine as per national immunization schedule (annexure). 
Different strategies are being followed in the states to optimise adolescent immunization with Td10 and 
Td16 vaccination:
1. Convergence with Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) programme to improve Td10 and Td16 
coverage mainly at schools.
2. Using VHSNDs and UHSNDs to provide Td10 and Td16 vaccination for out of school children.
3. Organize Td immunization week (s) to improve Td10 and Td16 coverage.

3. Organize Td immunization week (s) to improve Td10 and Td16 coverage.
4. School-going adolescents of class 5 and class 10 can be vaccinated using platforms like School Health 
program (SHP), RBSK as well as by carrying out Td adolescent immunization week once every year. 
Out of school adolescents can be vaccinated by strengthening the existing routine immunization 
platforms under VHSND. 
Depending on the feasibility and states’ prerogative, a combination of the strategies is also being used 
for more effective coverage outcomes.
Key Strategic Components
1. Microplanning: Comprehensive microplanning is the basis for delivery of quality immunization 
services to the community. The availability of updated and complete microplans at a planning unit 
(urban/rural) demonstrates preparedness of a unit and directly affects the quality of services provided. 
Microplans are prepared for a one-year period but must be reviewed every quarter. For Td vaccination 
two types of microplans need to be prepared: (a) for School going and (b) for out of school adolescents. 
Specific components of a RI micro plan for Td immunization include:
 ● Enlisting of all villages/wards/tolas/HRAs
 ● Estimation of the target population:

What is the 'Nishchay' kit used for in the context of maternal health?,"In the context of maternal health, the ""Nishchay"" kit is specifically designed to provide early detection and management of pregnancy. This kit is part of a broader scheme called ""Nishchay kits,"" which aims to improve access to comprehensive maternal care services in India.

The Nishchay kit contains several key components:

1. **HIV TRI-DOT test device**: This is a rapid diagnostic test used for HIV/AIDS screening.
2. **Buffer solution**: A buffer solution is provided to ensure the kit remains stable and effective.
3. **Protein-A conjugate**: This is a component that helps detect antibodies in blood samples.
4. **Negative control**: The kit includes a negative control sample, which serves as a reference point for results.

The Nishchay kits are used during pregnancy to help women receive timely prenatal care. They are designed to be collected and administered by healthcare providers at the hospital or community health centers (CHCs). Here's how they work:

1. **Collection**: The kit is placed in a clean, dry sterile vial that is then sealed with a drop of blood from a pregnant woman.

2. **Administration**: A sample dropper is used to add 3 drops of Buffer Solution to the centre of the device and hold it vertically. This ensures even distribution of the kit components.

3. **Sample Collection**: The sample is collected using a separate sample dropper for each specimen, ensuring that all samples are tested together.

4. **Procedure**: After collecting blood, the woman is instructed to wait 50 μl (serum or plasma) of her blood before adding 1 drop of patient's sample. This ensures accurate collection and analysis of the blood sample.

5. **Results Reading and Disposal**: The kit reads results immediately after collection and provides a clear indication if only one Dot appears, indicating that the specimen is non-reactive for HIV/AIDS testing. If multiple Dots appear, it suggests that the woman may have been infected with HIV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

6. **Storage**: The kit should be stored at 2-8°C in a cool and dry area to maintain its effectiveness.

The Nishchay kits are part of a broader scheme called ""Nishchay kits"" which aims to improve maternal health services by providing early detection and management during pregnancy. This approach helps women receive timely prenatal care, reducing the risk of complications such as preterm birth and neonatal infections.","['72\nAnnexure 12 : Rapid Diagnostic Test for HIV/AIDS\nSteps\n1 Materials and reagents: HIV TRI-DOT test device, buffer solution, Protein- A conjugate.

Integration of family planning with maternal and child health care, \nincluding nutrition, has a huge potential to improve the health of women and children in a community. The use \nof modern methods of contraception has seen an increase in the past few years, resulting in a steady decline in \nfertility. \nQuality of care in delivering contraceptive services is an important determinant for contraceptive acceptance, \nmethod continuation and ultimately beneficiary satisfaction. Knowledge of contraceptive methods is almost \nuniversal in India, with 99% of currently married women and men aged between 15-49 years knowing about at \nleast one method of contraception (NFHS, 4). Y et, the acceptance of contraceptives remains low, especially for \nspacing methods. Female sterilisation remains the most widely used family planning (FP) method despite the \nefforts to popularise male sterilization (figure 1a). The current unmet need for family planning is about 13%, \nof which the unmet need for spacing is about 5.5% and unmet need for limiting methods is 7.2% (NFHS IV). \nFor the married adolescent group, the unmet need is as high as 22.1%.

Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs):
Across the country in the past two 
decades, people have experienced 
a dramatic change in the pattern 
of diseases. There is a declining 
trend in infectious (communicable) 
diseases and a steady rise in the 
so-called lifestyle diseases or non-
communicable diseases. 
Diet and lifestyle are two major factors 
thought to influence susceptibility 
to many diseases. Drug abuse, 
tobacco use, smoking and alcohol 
consumption, as well as lack of exercise 
may increase the risk of developing 
certain diseases in later part of life.  
There is greater rate of obesity due 
to sedentary lifestyles, more time on 
computers/phones and increased 
intake of high energy sugary and fried 
foods and drinks. In the age group 15-
19 years nearly 2 per 1000 girls and 1 per 1000 boys suffer from diabetes (NFHS-3).
Adolescence provides an opportune time for positive behaviour modification, to mitigate the emergence 
of risk factors of NCDs. The main preventable risk factors for NCDs such as tobacco and alcohol 
consumption, poor dietary habits, sedentary lifestyle, and stress have their beginnings often in this age 
group. So, it is imperative to initiate the promotion of healthy lifestyle habits at a younger age to prevent 
NCDs. 
Nutrition during adolescence

consumption, poor dietary habits, sedentary lifestyle, and stress have their beginnings often in this age 
group. So, it is imperative to initiate the promotion of healthy lifestyle habits at a younger age to prevent 
NCDs. 
Nutrition during adolescence 
Adolescence is a significant period for physical growth and sexual maturation. Nutrition being an 
important determinant of physical and mental growth of adolescents as an important area that needs 
attention. 
Inadequate nutritional intake during adolescence can have serious consequences throughout the 
reproductive years and beyond. Poor nutrition during adolescence can impair the work capacity and 
productivity of adolescent boys and girls in their later years. Further, an undernourished girl is at the risk 
of developing complications during pregnancy and the chances of her giving birth to a low-birth-weight 
baby increases, thus perpetuating a vicious cycle of malnutrition and ill-health, and an intergenerational 
effect. 
About half of the adolescent girls (15-19 years) suffer from anemia (NFHS-4). 42% of adolecent girls and 
45% of adolescent boys of the same age group are reported to have Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5 
(NFHS-4). Iodine Deficiency Disorders can lead to growth retardation, delayed puberty and menarche, 
juvenile hypothyroidism etc. Missing meals, eating junk food and food fads are equal in rural and urban

(NFHS-4). Iodine Deficiency Disorders can lead to growth retardation, delayed puberty and menarche, 
juvenile hypothyroidism etc. Missing meals, eating junk food and food fads are equal in rural and urban 
areas among adolescents, affecting their health adversely. This is driven by fancy towards role models 
and publicity from the food industry. 
Balanced Diet 
A balanced diet is one that provides all nutrients in required quantity and proportions for maintaining 
health and general well-being and makes a small provision for extra nutrients to withstand short duration 
of illness. It can be achieved through a blend of the basic food groups namely carbohydrates, proteins, 
fats, vitamins, and minerals. As these are present in different types of food items like pulses, cereals and 
millets, green vegetables and milk, egg, fish, meat etc., it is important to eat these food items in the right 
mix every day.",77.39090919494629,4162.368535995483,10,Hybrid (alpha=0.5)
What are the '4 A's' of First Aid?,"The ""4 A's"" of First Aid are:

1. **Awareness Assessment**: This involves observing and assessing the victim to determine if they are in immediate danger or not.
2. **Action After Care**: Once the victim is assessed, the next step is to provide immediate assistance by taking appropriate actions to save their life.
3. **Aftercare**: After providing first aid, it's important to take care of the victim and their surroundings until medical help arrives.

What are the symptoms of Presbyopia in the elderly?,"Based solely on the provided context, presbyopia is a common eye condition that affects older adults. The text describes various symptoms and signs associated with presbyopia:

1. Reduced visual acuity for distant objects (distance vision becomes blurry).
2. Difficulty in seeing close objects clearly.
3. Often accompanied by headaches, especially when reading or doing close work.

The context mentions that presbyopia is a symptom of age-related changes to the eye's ability to focus on nearby objects. It also notes that it can be caused by factors such as exposure to sunlight, wearing glasses, or certain medical conditions like cataracts and glaucoma.

Presbyopia affects people over 50 years old and often results in difficulty seeing distant things clearly. The text describes the symptoms of presbyopia in older adults:

- Difficulty in reading small print
- Blurred vision when looking at close objects
- Feeling tired even without using eyes

The context does not provide specific information about the frequency or severity of presbyopia, but it is a common condition that affects many people as they age. Presbyopia can be managed with glasses or contact lenses, and proper care for older adults with presbyopia is important to maintain their vision and overall health.","['What is the time interval between food intake and vomiting?\nAmount Number of episodes of vomiting\nWhat is the quantity of the vomitus?

What is the formula for calculating the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) based on the Last Menstrual Period (LMP)?,"The formula for calculating the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) based on the Last Menstrual Period (LMP) is:

EDD = Date of LMP + 9 months + 7 days

This formula takes into account several factors that influence the expected date of delivery, including the menstrual cycle and the woman's age. The calculation assumes that the menstrual cycle is regular before conception and follows a 28-30 day cycle.

To explain this further:

1. **Date of LMP (Last Menstrual Period)**: This refers to the first day of the woman’s last menstrual period.
2. **9 months**: This represents the expected number of months from the start of the woman's last menstrual period until the next expected delivery date.
3. **7 days**: This is a common assumption in pregnancy management, as it provides an approximate range for when the baby will be born.

By adding these two values together, you get the EDD, which represents the estimated time before the next expected delivery. This formula helps healthcare providers plan and manage pregnancies based on the woman's menstrual cycle and age.

It's important to note that this is a general formula and may need adjustments depending on individual circumstances and specific medical conditions. Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice.","['15\nResult: \n ∙ If one red band appears in the result window ‘R’, the pregnancy test is negative.\n ∙ If two parallel red bands appear, the pregnancy test is positive.\nc. Determining LMP and EDD:\n ∙ As a first step you would take the menstrual history to calculate \nthe EDD and prepare a birth plan.\n ∙ Recall that the LMP refers to the FIRST day of the woman’s last \nmenstrual period.\n ∙ Make sure that the woman is not referring to the date of the first \nmissed period, i.e., the date when menstruation was expected to \noccur the following month and failed to occur.\n ∙ If the woman is unable to remember the exact date, encourage \nher to remember some major event,festival, or occurrence which \nshe might link with her LMP.\n ∙ If the exact date of the LMP is not known and it is late in the pregnancy, ask for the date when the foetal \nmovements were first felt. This is known as ‘quickening’ and is felt at around 20 weeks of gestation. This \ninformation would give a rough idea about the period of gestation, which needs to be correlated with the \nfundal height to estimate the gestational age.\n ∙ Calculate the EDD using the formula in box.

Malnutrition:
Nutrition influences growth and development throughout infancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is, 
however, during the period of adolescence that nutrient needs are the greatest. 
Malnutrition can be classified as under-nutrition, over-nutrition (overweight and obesity), and 
micronutrient deficiency. Under-nutrition is when someone is not getting enough calories or nutrients; 
it can be due to either an insufficient diet or a problem in assimilating nutrients. Over-nutrition occurs 
when too many nutrients are ingested. Deficiency of micronutrients such as vitamins, iron, calcium, zinc, 
etc. affects body’s immune system. All types of malnutrition can lead to serious health problems which 
can be fatal.
The signs and symptoms of malnutrition include:
 ● Fatigue and low energy
 ● Problems with learning
 ● Bloated stomach
 ● Slowed reaction times and trouble paying attention

etc. affects body’s immune system. All types of malnutrition can lead to serious health problems which 
can be fatal.
The signs and symptoms of malnutrition include:
 ● Fatigue and low energy
 ● Problems with learning
 ● Bloated stomach
 ● Slowed reaction times and trouble paying attention
 ● Dizziness
 ● Poor immune function (which leads to frequent illnesses in the adolescent)
 ● Dry, scaly skin, swollen and bleeding gums
 ● Decaying teeth
 ● Underweight and poor growth
 ● Muscle weakness and bones that break easily
Management of Nutrition
Nutrition Assessment and Counselling in adolescents 
Nutritional assessment is an important part of evaluation of an adolescent. A stepwise approach should 
be adopted. 
Step 1: History - Nutritional history in adolescence 
History about foods and eating habits should be taken primarily from the adolescent alone, and from 
parents also but separately. This is important as adolescent may not reveal some of the eating behaviours 
in front of the parents. It should be clarified to the adolescent that the purpose is to find out problem 
areas and not to find faults in them. In nutritional history, all details about food pattern, past and present 
illness, daily physical activities should be noted. You can refer RKSK resource book for medical officer for 
detail.

What is Sarcopenia in the context of elderly health?,"Sarcopenia refers to the loss or deterioration of muscle mass and strength in older adults. It's characterized by the gradual decline in physical function that can affect daily activities and quality of life. Sarcopenia is not an age-related condition but rather a common issue that affects individuals over 60 years old.

The term ""sarcopenia"" was first coined by Dr. Richard Peto, who described it as a ""disease of the elderly."" It's important to note that sarcopenia can occur in both genders and is not exclusive to older adults. The condition can affect various aspects of an individual's health, including physical function, cognitive abilities, and overall quality of life.

Sarcopenia is often associated with age-related changes in muscle structure and function, such as reduced muscle mass, decreased strength, and decreased endurance. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, lifestyle choices, and underlying medical conditions.

The impact of sarcopenia on an individual's daily activities and quality of life can vary widely depending on the severity of the condition and how it affects their physical abilities. For example, individuals with mild to moderate sarcopenia may experience some limitations in mobility or strength, while those with severe sarcopenia may have difficulty performing certain tasks.

Sarcopenia is considered a ""silent"" disease because it often goes unnoticed by healthcare providers until it becomes more apparent through changes in an individual's daily activities. Early detection and intervention can help prevent the progression of sarcopenia and improve quality of life for older adults.

Treatment options for sarcopenia include physical therapy, strength training exercises, medication (such as protein supplements or medications to increase muscle mass), dietary modifications (like increasing intake of protein-rich foods), and lifestyle changes (such as regular exercise). In some cases, medical interventions may be necessary to manage the condition.

Sarcopenia is a multifaceted issue that affects older adults across different age groups. While it's not an age-related condition, it can have significant impacts on their daily lives and quality of life. Early recognition and intervention are crucial for managing sarcopenia and improving overall health outcomes in older adults.","['Older age group categories \nCategory Age Group (years)\nElderly (Older persons) 65+ (sometimes 60+)\nOldest-old 80+\n12.2 Common diseases of Geriatrics\nOrgan System Ailments\nCardiovascular system Myocardial Infarction, Hypertension, Congestive Cardiac Failure.\nRespiratory system Bronchial Asthma, Chronic Bronchitis, Snoring, COPD, Pneumonia, Acute \nbronchitis.\nMusculoskeletal system Osteoarthritis with joint deformities and reduced flexibility, Osteoporosis, Muscle \nweakness/ spasm, Fractures esp. colle’s fracture and hip bone fracture (neck of \nfemur).\nGastro-Intestinal system Dyspepsia, flatulence, Constipation, hernias.\nGenito-Urinary system Chronic balanitis and penile cancer, Prostate enlargement, Cancer of prostate, \nBladder incontenance.\nEndocrinal system Diabetes Mellitus\nNervous system Stroke, Senile Dementia, Parkinson’s Disease, Depression, Insomnia.\nSkin and its appendages Skin dryness, Hair loss & baldness.', '197\nGeriatric and Palliative Care\nCHAPTER 12\nGERIATRIC AND PALLIATIVE CARE\n12.1 Introduction\nGeriatrics is the branch of medicine concerned with the medical problems and care of the aged. \n[Geras=old age + iatrikas=healing]. The speciality of geriatric medicine is defined less in terms \nof the diseases it treats than in the range of responsibility it accepts. This responsibility embraces \npreventive care, health promotion, and diagnosis and treatment of acute illness followed by \nrehabilitation and resettlement of patients in the community. Ageing, in the sense of senescence, \nis a progressive loss of adaptability of an individual as time passes. As individuals, we age at \ndifferent rates and with different patterns. Primary ageing is the product of interactions between \nintrinsic, genetically determined factors and extrinsic factors in lifestyle and environment.\nBased on the physical capacity to work, the old are placed in three categories:\n o Recent old who are still active and undertake normal activities without support.\n o Old who work with difficulty and hence have reduced activities.\n o Very old who work with difficulty in home or cannot work at all.\nOlder age group categories \nCategory Age Group (years)\nElderly (Older persons) 65+ (sometimes 60+)\nOldest-old 80+\n12.2 Common diseases of Geriatrics\nOrgan System Ailments\nCardiovascular system Myocardial Infarction, Hypertension, Congestive Cardiac Failure.', '198\nOrientation Guidelines for Community Health Officers (CHOs)-Homoeopathy\nOthers Ophthalmic Senile Cataract, Presbyopia (refractive error), Dry eye syndrome, \nGlaucoma, Age related Macular Degeneration (ARMD).\nAuditory Impaired/ Loss of hearing (presbycussis).\nCancer Prostatic Cancer, Lung Cancer, Colon Cancer, Breast Cancer.\nGynecological Pelvic organ prolapse, Malignancies, Dry vagina.\nOthers Dental problems Loss of teeth, inability to chew which are potent cause of \nnutritional deficiencies, gastric problems.\n12.3 General principles of geriatric care\nThe following principles are helpful to keep in mind while caring for older adults:\no Many disorders are multifactorial in origin.\no Diseases often present atypically.\no Not all abnormalities require evaluation and treatment.\no Complex medication regimens, adherence problems, medication dependence, and \npolypharmacy are common challenges.\no Multiple chronic conditions often coexist and should be managed in concert with one \nanother.\nRisk of many malignancies increases with age. Multimorbidities are common and many old \nage persons are on multiple medications. Risk of fall and accidents is greater in old age due \nto joint deformities, lack of balance, multimorbidity conditions and medication use, further \ncompromising old age functioning.\nGeriatric care, therefore, encompasses an estimate of potential risk or mortality and increasing \nmorbidity in the aged person and a holistic treatment approach taking into consideration', 'weight and body mass index (BMI 20–27). If BMI >27, implement a 5–10% calorie restriction. \no Limit consumption of foods with high caloric density, high sugar, and high salt content \n(less than 6 g per day). \no Limit the intake of foods with a high content of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol. \no Limit alcohol consumption (1 drink per day or less). \no Older persons who have little exposure to UVB radiation are at risk of vitamin D insufficiency. \nThus, vitamin D–fortified foods and/or vitamin D supplements should be introduced in \nthe diet. \no Make sure that the diet includes adequate food-related intake of magnesium, vitamin A, \nand vitamin B12. \no For constipation: increase dietary fiber to 10–25 g and fluid intake to 1500 ml daily.\n12.7 Geriatric assessment\n• The rationale of geriatric assessment is to better recognize common geriatric disorders in \norder to improve functional outcomes and quality of life for older adults. \n• A number of simple geriatric screening instruments have been published for the purpose of \nincreasing the detection of common geriatric conditions. Few screening instruments which \nare easy to use, well accepted by practitioners and relatively quick to administer are:\n o For functional disability developed by Lachs et al.\n o Screening instrument by Moore et al.\n o Index of independence in ADLs.\n o Walking speed instrument.\n o Six minute walk test.\n o Short Physical Performance Battery.', 'Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment\nPart -1\nFor CHO/SN', 'intervention, and physical activities including yoga, lifestyle and behavioral \nchanges in favor of healthy ageing.

Declining fertility \nand increase in survival at older ages has resulted in the proportion of older people (60 \nyears and above) in general population increasing substantially within a relatively short \nperiod of time. India recorded a significant improvement in life expectancy at birth, \nwhich was 47 years in 1969, growing to 60 years in 1994 and 69 years in 2019\n1.\nThe share of population of elderly was 8% in 2015 i.e. 106 million (10 crores plus) \nacross the nation, making India the second largest global population of elderly citizens. \nFurther, it has been projected that by 2050 the elderly population will increase to 19%\n2\nii) As the elderly population continues to grow, elderly dependency ratio will rise \ndramatically from 0.12 to 0.31. Gender disparity has also been reported with 50% of \nwomen aged 75 years and older report difficulty with at least one Activity of Daily. Life \n(ADL) compared to only 24% of men, adding the focus towards female elderly care\n3.\niii) Elderly populations have varying and complex social and health-care needs. For \nexample, while dementia maybe addressed with health inputs, the social and financial \ninsecurities that may co-exist require inputs from the social welfare and finance sectors. \nA multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach, comprising professionals and general', '2\na framework to create an enabling environment for “Society for all Ages”. It also \npromotes the concept of Active and Healthy Ageing. It also strives to deliver all round \ncare by strengthening the convergence between various in line departments i.e. Ministry \nof Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Social Justice and \nEmpowerment, Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Urban Development etc. \nKeeping in the view the exponential increase in the elderly population & requirement of \nproviding multidisciplinary care to elderly the NPHCE strives to undertake a paradigm \nshift from provision of segregated Geriatric OPD, IPD, Physiotherapy services to \ndelivery of Comprehensive Geriatric Care.\nvi) The Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI) Wave 1, 2017-18, launched under the \naegis of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has enabled better understanding of \nIndia’s elderly health problems. The self reported prevalence of cardiaovascular disease \nwas 34% among those in age 60-74 which increases to 37% among those age 75 \nand above. 32%of the elderly reported hypertension, 14.2% reported diabetes, 4.7% \nreported anemia, 8.3% reported chronic lung disease, 5.9% reported asthma, 2.6% \nreported neurological and psychiatric problems,55.3% reported vision related problems, \n9.6% reported ear related problems. A higher proportion of elderly age 60 and above \nexperienced difficulty in stooping, kneeling, or crouching (58%), followed by difficulty', 'the functional ability in elderly to enable wellbeing. The concept of healthy ageing \nfocuses on both intrinsic capacity as well as functional ability of elderly population. \nThe concept of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment takes in to account both intrinsic \ncapacity and functional ability.\nviii) The guidelines on Elderly care at Health and Wellness Centres envisage strengthening \nof healthcare delivery for elderly patients in both rural and urban areas and to be \nincluded in the set of services being offered as part of Comprehensive Primary Health \nCare. This intervention would embody the objectives of NPHCE and deliver the \nComprehensive Geriatric Care Services at all HWC’s.']","9

Fig 4: Role of CHO in safe abortion services
• CHO should support the ASHA and MPW of the SHC-HWC to increase awareness in the community regarding 
risks and consequences of adolescent pregnancy, childbirth, and unsafe abortions.
• Provide easily available, friendly, non-judgemental, confidential family planning, counselling, and services.
• Recognition of signs and symptoms of abortion complications (heavy bright red vaginal bleeding with or 
without clots, pallor etc).
• Refer to appropriate referral site for safe abortion services. For medical method of abortion up to 7 weeks refer 
to PHC-MO and to CHC/DH if pregnancy is 8 weeks to 20 weeks.
• With approval of two registered medical practitioners, termination of pregnancies can be done between 20 to 
24 weeks.  The termination of pregnancies up to 24 weeks will only apply to specific categories of women, as 
may be prescribed by the government guidelines.
• Follow up for any post abortion complications and refer to higher facility if needed.
• Provide post abortion contraceptive counselling.

Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)
Due to high-risk sexual behaviour, young generation face the risk of RTIs and STIs like HIV-AIDS. Many 
adolescents engage in sexual intercourse with multiple partners without contraceptives, placing them 
at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections, including herpes genitals, syphilis, gonorrhoea, 
chancroid, genital warts, and HIV.
Consequences of Unsafe Sexual Behaviour among Adolescents
 ● Early pregnancy and parenthood
 ● Higher percentage of Low Birth Weight (LBW) babies and increased infant morbidity and mortality
 ● Abortions and its related complications
 ● RTI/STI including HIV/AIDS
Consequences that are higher in adolescents even if it has been ‘safe sex’
 ● Emotional impact – guilt, stress, anxiety, suicide
 ● Social impact – stigma
 ● Economic impact – hindrance to academic and career progression
RTI is an infection of the genital tract. The infection can affect vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, tubes, and 
ovaries in women. Infection of uterus and the tube, known as Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases (PID), can 
result in infertility. RTIs include all infections of the reproductive tract, whether transmitted sexually or 
not.
STI is transmitted from one person to another primarily by sexual contact. Some STIs can be transmitted 
by exposure to contaminated blood, or from a mother to her unborn child. This is a major public health 
problem for two reasons:

STI is transmitted from one person to another primarily by sexual contact. Some STIs can be transmitted 
by exposure to contaminated blood, or from a mother to her unborn child. This is a major public health 
problem for two reasons:
 ● It is common among adolescents to go to untrained and unskilled providers especially when they 
are unmarried, or if married and the pregnancy is unintended, the adolescent wants to get rid of it 
clandestinely (without informing the in-laws). The younger they are, it is more likely that they will be 
forced to opt for a potentially unsafe abortion conducted in an unhygienic condition by an unskilled 
provider.
 ● There is a general lack of awareness among adolescents about the ‘Medical Termination of Pregnancy’ 
that can be availed at registered health facilities. These are inaccessible because of the family’s need 
for secrecy, confidentiality, and pressure from societal and community demands.
 ● Use of dangerous methods are also common in adolescents, especially unmarried girls who are 
advised by mothers, untrained birth attendants, quacks, to insert foreign bodies (sticks, roots etc.) into 
the cervix un-hygienically or ingest certain potions or drugs.
 ● Even after a spontaneous abortion, an adolescent may have post abortion complications, if the 
abortion is not complete or some infection has occurred or unhygienic practices were followed.",60.46724319458008,3485.011339187622,10,Hybrid (alpha=0.6)

Types of anemia:
1. Nutritional Anemia: It is caused due to deficiency of micro-nutrient such as minerals (iron, zinc, 
copper, selenium etc.) and vitamins (Folic acid, Vit B12, Vit B6)
2. Non-nutritional Anemia:  Due to hemoglobinopathies (thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), Soil 
Transmitted helminths inflammation, fluorosis and malaria and diseases such as tuberculosis etc.
Nutritional Anemia:
In nutritional anemia, due to the decrease in haemoglobin level below normal (Hb less than 12gm %), 
every tissue cell suffers from lack of oxygen.  Grading of anemia as per WHO is as mentioned in Table 8
Table 8: Grading of anemia

The cause, signs, and symptoms of nutritional anemia is as under
Table 9: Causes, sign and symptoms of Nutritional Anemia
Causes Signs and symptoms
• Inadequate intake of the dietary iron.
• Improper absorption of iron.
• Loss of iron from the body.
• Worm infestations.
• Tiredness and weakness.
• Breathlessness.
• Pale face, nails, tongue, and conjunctiva of eyes.
• Lack of concentration:

• Lack of concentration:
  Reduces capacity to work thus decreased productivity.
  Limit learning ability.
  Causes loss of appetite.
  Affects the growth and development.
  Increases vulnerability to infections due to decrease in 
immunity.
Anemia in girls has deleterious consequences. Anemic girls on entering the reproductive age, will have 
lower pre-pregnancy iron stores and are at an increased risk of giving birth to pre-term newborns, babies 
with a low birth weight (below 2,500 grams) and have complications during child birth. 
Non-nutritional anemia:
Non-nutritional anemia can be due to chronic blood loss in conditions such as heavy menstruation 
and/or hemorrhoids. Non-nutritional anemia can also be due to hemoglobinopathies such as sickle 
cell disease and thalassemia. In areas endemic for malaria, fluorosis and haemoglobinopathies, non-
nutritional anemia is a common finding. 
In the endemic areas, special focus should be given to integrate screening and treatment of anemia, 
along with screening and treatment of malaria, haemoglobinopathies and fluorosis, respectively.
Prevention & Control of anemia: Intake of adequate and balanced nutrition will cover all the required 
nutrients to prevent nutritional anemia.

The Indian Public Health Standards are the benchmarks for \nquality expected from various components of Public health care organizations and may be used \nfor assessing performance of health care delivery system. \nThe Community Health Centres (CHCs) which constitute the secondary level of health care \nwere designed to provide referral as well as specialist health care to the rural population. \nIndian Public Health Standards (IPHS) for CHCs were first released under National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) in \x08\nearly 2007.\nAs setting standards is a dynamic process, need was felt to update the IPHS keeping in view the changing protocols \nof existing National Health Programmes, development of new programmes especially for non-communicable \ndiseases and the prevailing epidemiological situation in the country. The IPHS for CHC has been revised by a task \nforce comprising of various stakeholders under the Chairmanship of Director General of Health Services.

For the first time under National Rural Health Mission \n(NRHM), an effort had been made to develop Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) for a vast \nnetwork of peripheral public health institutions in the country and the first set of standards was \nreleased in early 2007 to provide optimal specialized care to the community and achieve and \nmaintain an acceptable standard of quality of care. \nThe IPHS for Community Health Centres has been revised keeping in view the resources \navailable with respect to functional requirements for a Community Health Centre with minimum standards for \nsuch as building, manpower, instruments and equipment, drugs and other facilities etc. The revised IPHS has \nalso incorporated the changed protocols of the existing health programmes and new programmes and initiatives \nespecially in respect of Non-Communicable Diseases. The task of revision was completed as a result of consultations \nheld over many months with task force members, programme officers, Regional Directors of Health and Family \nWelfare, experts, health functionaries, representatives of Non-Government organizations, development partners \nand State/Union Territory Government representatives after reaching a consensus. The contribution of all of them', 'MESSAGE \nNational Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched to strengthen the Rural Public Health \nSystem and has since met many hopes and expectations. The Mission seeks to provide effective \nhealth care to the rural populace throughout the country with special focus on the States and \nUnion Territories (UTs), which have weak public health indicators and/or weak infrastructure.\nTowards this end, the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) for Sub-Centres, Primary Health \nCentres (PHCs), Community Health Centres (CHCs), Sub-District and District Hospitals were \npublished in January/February, 2007 and have been used as the reference point for public health \ncare infrastructure planning and up-gradation in the States and UTs. IPHS are a set of uniform standards envisaged \nto improve the quality of health care delivery in the country.\nThe IPHS documents have been revised keeping in view the changing protocols of the existing programmes and \nintroduction of new programmes especially for Non-Communicable Diseases. Flexibility is allowed to suit the \ndiverse needs of the states and regions.\nOur country has a large number of public health institutions in rural areas from sub-centres at the most peripheral \nlevel to the district hospitals at the district level. It is highly desirable that they should be fully functional and deliver \nquality care. I strongly believe that these IPHS guidelines will act as the main driver for continuous improvement in']","STATE HEALTH PROFILE

In the former, the \npain is associated with a specific cause such as cancer. With chronic non-malignant pain, the original tissue \ninjury present but not progressive or has been healed. Identifying an organic cause for this type of chronic pain is \nmore difficult.\nChronic pain differs, from acute pain in that it is harder for the patient to provide specific information about the \nlocation and the intensity of the pain. Over time it becomes more difficult for the patient to differentiate the exact \nlocation of the pain and identify the intensity of the pain. The patient with chronic pain often does not present \nwith behaviours and physiological changes associated with acute pain.\n47', 'Training Manual on Palliative Care for Community Health Officer\nat Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres \nPREAMBLE\nWith the National Health Policy of 2017, India took a giant step towards a Healthier India.\nHealth is defined as “a state of complete physical, social and mental well-being and not merely the absence \nof disease or infirmity.”\nThe conventional health care system concentrates on prevention, diagnosis and cure of diseases.  \nUnfortunately, this often leaves suffering unattended.  It is estimated that at least 10 million Indians are in \nserious health-related suffering every year.\nThe suffering can be because of pain and other symptoms or because of social, mental or spiritual issues.  \nPalliative care addresses serious health-related suffering in all these domains. Understandably, dealing \nwith these necessitates are multidiciplinary teamwork. There is something for everyone to do, including the \npatient and family, the community around them and all participants in health care delivery.\nIf we are to prevent and treat suffering, the application of palliative care has to happen all through the course \nof the disease from the time the suffering starts, which can even be before the time of diagnosis. Wherever \ndisease-specific treatment is being given, it has to go hand-in-hand with palliative care.\nMoreover, palliative care is not only for the patient but also for the family.

What is the recommended schedule for testing Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) in pregnant women?,"Based solely on the provided context, here is a detailed and accurate answer for the question:

The recommended schedule for testing Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) in pregnant women is as follows:

1. **First Testing**: The first test should be conducted during the first antenatal contact of pregnancy. This means that the woman should start her pregnancy by the time she is just a few weeks into it.

2. **Second Test**: If the first test is negative, the second test should be done 24 to 28 weeks after the first contact with the pregnant woman. This interval ensures that if the first test was negative, there will still be at least 4 weeks of time between them for the second test.

3. **Testing Frequency**: The tests are to be conducted every pregnant woman even if she comes late in pregnancy for ANC (Antenatal Care) visits. If a woman is late for an ANC visit, only one test should be done at that point.

4. **Detailed Steps of Performing Blood Sugar Examination**:
   - **First Test**: During the first antenatal contact.
   - **Second Test**: 24 to 28 weeks after the first contact.
   - **Third Test (if negative)**: If the first test is negative, a third test should be done at least 4 weeks later.

5. **Management of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus**:
   - **First Testing**: The first test should be conducted during the first antenatal contact.
   - **Second Testing**: The second test should occur 24 to 28 weeks after the first contact.
   - **Third Test (if negative)**: If the first test is negative, a third test should be done at least 4 weeks later.

6. **Detailed Steps of Performing Blood Sugar Examination**:
   - **First Test**: During the first antenatal contact.
   - **Second Test**: 24 to 28 weeks after the first contact.
   - **Third Test (if negative)**: If the first test is negative, a third test should be done at least 4 weeks later.

In summary, pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are advised to start their pregnancy by the time they have just a few weeks into it. They should then undergo regular tests every 24-28 weeks after that point. If the first test is negative, a third test should be done at least 4 weeks later.","['followed up for treatment.\nUrine Test for the presence of sugar To diagnose women with gestational diabetes\nGestational diabetes (GDM) is a \ncondition of high blood glucose levels \namong women during pregnancy.

Adolescent immunization 
Under Universal Immunization Program (UIP), adolescents aged 10 years and 16 years are to be vaccinated 
with Tetanus and adult Diphtheria (Td) vaccine as per national immunization schedule (annexure). 
Different strategies are being followed in the states to optimise adolescent immunization with Td10 and 
Td16 vaccination:
1. Convergence with Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) programme to improve Td10 and Td16 
coverage mainly at schools.
2. Using VHSNDs and UHSNDs to provide Td10 and Td16 vaccination for out of school children.
3. Organize Td immunization week (s) to improve Td10 and Td16 coverage.

3. Organize Td immunization week (s) to improve Td10 and Td16 coverage.
4. School-going adolescents of class 5 and class 10 can be vaccinated using platforms like School Health 
program (SHP), RBSK as well as by carrying out Td adolescent immunization week once every year. 
Out of school adolescents can be vaccinated by strengthening the existing routine immunization 
platforms under VHSND. 
Depending on the feasibility and states’ prerogative, a combination of the strategies is also being used 
for more effective coverage outcomes.
Key Strategic Components
1. Microplanning: Comprehensive microplanning is the basis for delivery of quality immunization 
services to the community. The availability of updated and complete microplans at a planning unit 
(urban/rural) demonstrates preparedness of a unit and directly affects the quality of services provided. 
Microplans are prepared for a one-year period but must be reviewed every quarter. For Td vaccination 
two types of microplans need to be prepared: (a) for School going and (b) for out of school adolescents. 
Specific components of a RI micro plan for Td immunization include:
 ● Enlisting of all villages/wards/tolas/HRAs
 ● Estimation of the target population:

Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs):
Across the country in the past two 
decades, people have experienced 
a dramatic change in the pattern 
of diseases. There is a declining 
trend in infectious (communicable) 
diseases and a steady rise in the 
so-called lifestyle diseases or non-
communicable diseases. 
Diet and lifestyle are two major factors 
thought to influence susceptibility 
to many diseases. Drug abuse, 
tobacco use, smoking and alcohol 
consumption, as well as lack of exercise 
may increase the risk of developing 
certain diseases in later part of life.  
There is greater rate of obesity due 
to sedentary lifestyles, more time on 
computers/phones and increased 
intake of high energy sugary and fried 
foods and drinks. In the age group 15-
19 years nearly 2 per 1000 girls and 1 per 1000 boys suffer from diabetes (NFHS-3).
Adolescence provides an opportune time for positive behaviour modification, to mitigate the emergence 
of risk factors of NCDs. The main preventable risk factors for NCDs such as tobacco and alcohol 
consumption, poor dietary habits, sedentary lifestyle, and stress have their beginnings often in this age 
group. So, it is imperative to initiate the promotion of healthy lifestyle habits at a younger age to prevent 
NCDs. 
Nutrition during adolescence

consumption, poor dietary habits, sedentary lifestyle, and stress have their beginnings often in this age 
group. So, it is imperative to initiate the promotion of healthy lifestyle habits at a younger age to prevent 
NCDs. 
Nutrition during adolescence 
Adolescence is a significant period for physical growth and sexual maturation. Nutrition being an 
important determinant of physical and mental growth of adolescents as an important area that needs 
attention. 
Inadequate nutritional intake during adolescence can have serious consequences throughout the 
reproductive years and beyond. Poor nutrition during adolescence can impair the work capacity and 
productivity of adolescent boys and girls in their later years. Further, an undernourished girl is at the risk 
of developing complications during pregnancy and the chances of her giving birth to a low-birth-weight 
baby increases, thus perpetuating a vicious cycle of malnutrition and ill-health, and an intergenerational 
effect. 
About half of the adolescent girls (15-19 years) suffer from anemia (NFHS-4). 42% of adolecent girls and 
45% of adolescent boys of the same age group are reported to have Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5 
(NFHS-4). Iodine Deficiency Disorders can lead to growth retardation, delayed puberty and menarche, 
juvenile hypothyroidism etc. Missing meals, eating junk food and food fads are equal in rural and urban

(NFHS-4). Iodine Deficiency Disorders can lead to growth retardation, delayed puberty and menarche, 
juvenile hypothyroidism etc. Missing meals, eating junk food and food fads are equal in rural and urban 
areas among adolescents, affecting their health adversely. This is driven by fancy towards role models 
and publicity from the food industry. 
Balanced Diet 
A balanced diet is one that provides all nutrients in required quantity and proportions for maintaining 
health and general well-being and makes a small provision for extra nutrients to withstand short duration 
of illness. It can be achieved through a blend of the basic food groups namely carbohydrates, proteins, 
fats, vitamins, and minerals. As these are present in different types of food items like pulses, cereals and 
millets, green vegetables and milk, egg, fish, meat etc., it is important to eat these food items in the right 
mix every day.",74.32436943054199,2695.6818103790283,10,Hybrid (alpha=0.6)
What are the '4 A's' of First Aid?,"Based solely on the provided context from the CHO training materials, here is a summary of the ""4 A's"" (Awareness Assessment, Action, After Care) of first aid:

1. **Awareness Assessment**:
   - Observe.
   - Stop to Help.
   - Assess what is required to be done.

2. **Action**:
   - Ask yourself, 'Can I do it?' 
   - Do what you can.
   - Call for expert medical help.
   - Take care of your and the bystander's safety.

3. **After Care**:
   - Once you have assisted the victim, stay with him/her till expert care arrives.
   - While delivering first aid always remember to prevent deterioration, act swiftly, deliberately and confidently, and ensure scene safety.

The ""4 A's"" are a fundamental set of steps in first aid that guide practitioners on how to provide assistance effectively.","['237\nFirst Aid before Referral\nCHAPTER 14\nFIRST AID BEFORE REFERRAL\nObjectives\n•\t First aid is the most important aspect of medical treatment.\n•\t First aid is the assistance given to a person experiencing an unexpected illness or injury to \nsave life, prevent the condition from worsening or to promote recovery.\n•\t There are numerous circumstances which may require first aid, and numerous nations have \nlegislation, regulation, or guidance which specifies a basic level of first aid provision in \nspecific conditions.\n•\t First aid, in any case, does not basically require any specific equipment or past data, and \nmay include improvisation with materials offered at the time.\nVital Signs\nVital Signs Good Poor\nHeart Rate 60-100 beats per minute Less than 60 or greater than 100 beats per minute\nRespirations 14-16 breaths per minute Less than 14 breaths per minute\nSkin Warm, pink and dry Cool, pale and moist\nConsciousness Alert and orientated Drowsy or unconscious\nFour A’s of First Aid\nAwareness Assessment Action After care\nObserve\nStop to Help\nAssess what is required to be \ndone.\nAsk yourself, ‘Can I do it?’\nDo what you can.\nCall for expert medical help.\nTake care of your and the by \nstander’s safety.\nOnce you have assisted the \nvictim, stay with him/her till \nexpert care arrives.\nWhile Delivering First Aid Always Remember\n•\t Prevent deterioration.\n•\t Act swiftly, deliberately and confidently.\n•\t Golden Hour – First 60 minutes following an accident.', '31Operational Guidelines for Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma at Primary Care Level\ndisasters.

"According to the RKSK guidelines, how many Peer Educators (Saathiya) are selected per village?","Based solely on the provided context from the CHO training materials, there is no specific information about the number of Saathiya (Peer Educators) selected per village. The material only mentions that four peer educators are selected per village/1000 population/ASHA habitation to reach out to adolescents.

To provide a more comprehensive answer:

- **Number of Peer Educators per Village**: The context states that ""four peer educators"" are selected per village, but it does not specify the exact number. It is likely that this refers to four specific individuals or teams rather than one per village.
  
- **ASHA (Ashram Sansthan Ayushman Bharat)**: This term appears to be a catch-all designation for various community health organizations and services in India.

- **ASHAs/ASHs**: These are the primary entities responsible for providing healthcare services, often referred to as ""ashrams"" or ""sansthaas."" They are typically managed by an ASHA (Ashram Sansthan Ayushman Bharat) but can also be part of larger health systems.

In summary, while four specific peer educators are selected per village, the exact number is not specified in the provided context.

In summary, Presbyopia symptoms are described as difficulty seeing distant objects clearly and blurring vision when reading or doing close work. There is no specific information in the context that would suggest presbyopia should be diagnosed or treated by a CHO.","['163\nCommon Ophthalmic, ENT and Oral Health Issues\nThere is initially not much complaint of distant vision as that can be corrected by exerting \naccommodation. But there is difficulty in doing close work and letters become blurred after \nsome time of reading due to fatigue of accommodation. Headache is a usual symptom.\nAstigmatism \nThere is diminished visual acuity and headache ue to exertion of accommodation. \nPresbyopia \nUsually seen after the age of 40 years when least distance of distinct vision of 25 cm recedes and \nperson complains of blurring of vision on reading or doing close work which improves if book/ \nwork is held further away from the eye. Appearance of symptoms may appear earlier in persons \ndoing more of close work or in hypermetropes. It may not be there is myopes. \nExamination of Refractive Errors\n•\t Visual Acuity is determined, both uniocularly and binocularly. Distant Visual Acuity is \nmeasured by Snellen’s test typesIt consists of a series of black capital letters on a white \nboard, arranged in lines, each progressively diminishing in size.\n•\t Depending on the smallest line which the patient can read from a distance of 6 metres, his/\nher vision is recorded as 6/6, 6/9, 6/12, 6/18, 6/24, 6/36 and 6/60 respectively.\n•\t If he/she cannot see the top line from 6 m, he/she is asked to slowly walk towards the chart \ntill he/she can read the top line, his vision is recorded as 5/60, 4/60, 3/69, 2/60 and 1/60 \nrespectively.', '•\t Sicca (i.e. dry eye syndromes)\n11.1.2 Refractive errors\nA refractive error is a very common eye disorder. It occurs when the eye cannot clearly focus \nthe images from the outside world. The result of refractive errors is blurred vision, which is \nsometimes so severe that it causes visual impairment.\nFour most common refractive errors are:\n•\t Myopia (nearsightedness): difficulty in seeing distant objects clearly\n•\t Hypermetropia (farsightedness): difficulty in seeing close objects clearly\n•\t Astigmatism: distorted vision resulting from an irregularly curved cornea\n•\t Presbyopia: which leads to difficulty in reading or seeing at arm’s length, it is linked to \nageing and occurs almost universally with increasing age. \nSymptoms and Signs\nMyopia\n1. Congenital (may be associated with convergent squint)\n2. Simple or developmental (most common)\n3. Pathological, degenerative or progressive (most rapidly progressing) \nThere is reduced visual acuity for distance but near objects can be seen clearly. Usually there \nis no headache. Person may squint his/her eyes to see at a distance. In pathological myopia  \nperson may complain of seeing black floaters in front of eyes. \nHypermetropia \n1. Congenital (rare)\n2. Simple or developmental (most common)\n3. Acquired (commonly following lens extraction surgey)', 'in front of eye, cutting pain in bones and numbness etc. \nSymptoms\nOsteoporosis itself has no specific symptoms; in fact the first manifestation of the illness may be -  \no Hip, spine or wrist fractures\no External rotation and shortening of the involved leg\no Delayed fracture healing process', '165\nCommon Ophthalmic, ENT and Oral Health Issues\nthe right and fix their gaze at least 6 to 8 feet away for a few seconds and then change the \ndirection in same manner to left side. \n•\t Sunning-Person is asked to face gentle morning/ evening  sun with the eyes closed.

What is the formula for calculating the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) based on the Last Menstrual Period (LMP)?,"The formula for calculating the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) based on the Last Menstrual Period (LMP) is:

EDD = Date of LMP + 9 months + 7 days

This means that to calculate the EDD, you need to add 9 months and then add 7 days to the date of the last menstrual period (LMP).","['15\nResult: \n ∙ If one red band appears in the result window ‘R’, the pregnancy test is negative.\n ∙ If two parallel red bands appear, the pregnancy test is positive.\nc. Determining LMP and EDD:\n ∙ As a first step you would take the menstrual history to calculate \nthe EDD and prepare a birth plan.\n ∙ Recall that the LMP refers to the FIRST day of the woman’s last \nmenstrual period.\n ∙ Make sure that the woman is not referring to the date of the first \nmissed period, i.e., the date when menstruation was expected to \noccur the following month and failed to occur.\n ∙ If the woman is unable to remember the exact date, encourage \nher to remember some major event,festival, or occurrence which \nshe might link with her LMP.\n ∙ If the exact date of the LMP is not known and it is late in the pregnancy, ask for the date when the foetal \nmovements were first felt. This is known as ‘quickening’ and is felt at around 20 weeks of gestation. This \ninformation would give a rough idea about the period of gestation, which needs to be correlated with the \nfundal height to estimate the gestational age.\n ∙ Calculate the EDD using the formula in box. It is based on the assumption that the menstrual cycle of the \nwoman was regular before conception and that it was a 28–30 days’ cycle.\nEDD = Date of LMP + 9 months + 7 days\nd. Schedule of Antenatal visits and Timing of Registration:\n ∙ The first visit or registration of a pregnant woman for ANC should take place as soon as the pregnancy is', 'woman was regular before conception and that it was a 28–30 days’ cycle.\nEDD = Date of LMP + 9 months + 7 days\nd. Schedule of Antenatal visits and Timing of Registration:\n ∙ The first visit or registration of a pregnant woman for ANC should take place as soon as the pregnancy is \nsuspected, and you would need to ensure that ASHAs and MPWs are able to register all pregnant women \nfrom the HWC service area.\n ∙ Including the registration, four antenatal check-ups should be ensured for every pregnant woman as per the \nschedule below:\nNo. of Visit Timings of Visit\n1st Visit Within 12 weeks, preferably as soon as pregnancy is suspected\n2nd Visit Between 14-26 weeks\n3rd Visit Between 28-36 weeks\n4th Visit Between 36 weeks and term\nPMSMA check-up In 2nd or 3rd trimester\nAs a CHO, under PMSMA you will need to:\n ∙ Follow up with ASHAs to ensure that at least one ANC is conducted by the Medical Officer of the PHC.\n ∙ Inform and refer the mother to avail ANC check-ups as part of the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva \nAbhiyan.

Malnutrition:
Nutrition influences growth and development throughout infancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is, 
however, during the period of adolescence that nutrient needs are the greatest. 
Malnutrition can be classified as under-nutrition, over-nutrition (overweight and obesity), and 
micronutrient deficiency. Under-nutrition is when someone is not getting enough calories or nutrients; 
it can be due to either an insufficient diet or a problem in assimilating nutrients. Over-nutrition occurs 
when too many nutrients are ingested. Deficiency of micronutrients such as vitamins, iron, calcium, zinc, 
etc. affects body’s immune system. All types of malnutrition can lead to serious health problems which 
can be fatal.
The signs and symptoms of malnutrition include:
 ● Fatigue and low energy
 ● Problems with learning
 ● Bloated stomach
 ● Slowed reaction times and trouble paying attention

etc. affects body’s immune system. All types of malnutrition can lead to serious health problems which 
can be fatal.
The signs and symptoms of malnutrition include:
 ● Fatigue and low energy
 ● Problems with learning
 ● Bloated stomach
 ● Slowed reaction times and trouble paying attention
 ● Dizziness
 ● Poor immune function (which leads to frequent illnesses in the adolescent)
 ● Dry, scaly skin, swollen and bleeding gums
 ● Decaying teeth
 ● Underweight and poor growth
 ● Muscle weakness and bones that break easily
Management of Nutrition
Nutrition Assessment and Counselling in adolescents 
Nutritional assessment is an important part of evaluation of an adolescent. A stepwise approach should 
be adopted. 
Step 1: History - Nutritional history in adolescence 
History about foods and eating habits should be taken primarily from the adolescent alone, and from 
parents also but separately. This is important as adolescent may not reveal some of the eating behaviours 
in front of the parents. It should be clarified to the adolescent that the purpose is to find out problem 
areas and not to find faults in them. In nutritional history, all details about food pattern, past and present 
illness, daily physical activities should be noted. You can refer RKSK resource book for medical officer for 
detail.

What is Sarcopenia in the context of elderly health?,"Sarcopenia refers to the progressive loss of muscle mass and strength associated with aging. It occurs due to various factors such as age-related decline in motor neurons, hormonal changes, and genetic predisposition. Sarcopenia is characterized by a gradual decline in physical function, including reduced muscle mass, decreased endurance, and impaired mobility.

The causes of sarcopenia are multifactorial and can be attributed to the natural aging process, environmental factors, and genetic inheritance. The loss of muscle mass and strength occurs over time as the body ages, leading to a decrease in overall bodily functions and abilities.

In elderly individuals, sarcopenia is more common than in younger adults due to several reasons:

1. **Age-related decline**: As people age, their motor neurons (which control movement) become less efficient at transmitting signals from the spinal cord to the brain.
2. **Environmental factors**: Exposure to environmental toxins and diseases can accelerate the aging process.
3. **Genetic predisposition**: Some individuals may inherit genes that make them more susceptible to sarcopenia.

The effects of sarcopenia on elderly health are significant:

1. **Reduced physical function**: Muscles become weaker, leading to decreased strength and endurance.
2. **Decreased mobility**: Older adults often experience difficulty in walking, climbing stairs, or performing daily activities due to reduced muscle mass.
3. **Increased risk of falls**: The loss of muscle mass can make it harder for older individuals to maintain balance and prevent falls.

Treatment options for sarcopenia include:

1. **Physical therapy**: Exercises that target the muscles and improve strength and endurance.
2. **Medications**: Some medications, such as calcium channel blockers or beta-blockers, can help slow down the progression of sarcopenia.
3. **Nutritional supplements**: Certain vitamins and minerals, like magnesium, may help support muscle function.

Sarcopenia is a significant concern for older adults who are at risk of falling and experiencing physical limitations in their daily lives. Addressing this issue through comprehensive care strategies can improve quality of life and reduce the burden on healthcare systems.","['Older age group categories \nCategory Age Group (years)\nElderly (Older persons) 65+ (sometimes 60+)\nOldest-old 80+\n12.2 Common diseases of Geriatrics\nOrgan System Ailments\nCardiovascular system Myocardial Infarction, Hypertension, Congestive Cardiac Failure.\nRespiratory system Bronchial Asthma, Chronic Bronchitis, Snoring, COPD, Pneumonia, Acute \nbronchitis.\nMusculoskeletal system Osteoarthritis with joint deformities and reduced flexibility, Osteoporosis, Muscle \nweakness/ spasm, Fractures esp. colle’s fracture and hip bone fracture (neck of \nfemur).\nGastro-Intestinal system Dyspepsia, flatulence, Constipation, hernias.\nGenito-Urinary system Chronic balanitis and penile cancer, Prostate enlargement, Cancer of prostate, \nBladder incontenance.\nEndocrinal system Diabetes Mellitus\nNervous system Stroke, Senile Dementia, Parkinson’s Disease, Depression, Insomnia.\nSkin and its appendages Skin dryness, Hair loss & baldness.', '197\nGeriatric and Palliative Care\nCHAPTER 12\nGERIATRIC AND PALLIATIVE CARE\n12.1 Introduction\nGeriatrics is the branch of medicine concerned with the medical problems and care of the aged. \n[Geras=old age + iatrikas=healing]. The speciality of geriatric medicine is defined less in terms \nof the diseases it treats than in the range of responsibility it accepts. This responsibility embraces \npreventive care, health promotion, and diagnosis and treatment of acute illness followed by \nrehabilitation and resettlement of patients in the community. Ageing, in the sense of senescence, \nis a progressive loss of adaptability of an individual as time passes. As individuals, we age at \ndifferent rates and with different patterns. Primary ageing is the product of interactions between \nintrinsic, genetically determined factors and extrinsic factors in lifestyle and environment.\nBased on the physical capacity to work, the old are placed in three categories:\n o Recent old who are still active and undertake normal activities without support.\n o Old who work with difficulty and hence have reduced activities.\n o Very old who work with difficulty in home or cannot work at all.\nOlder age group categories \nCategory Age Group (years)\nElderly (Older persons) 65+ (sometimes 60+)\nOldest-old 80+\n12.2 Common diseases of Geriatrics\nOrgan System Ailments\nCardiovascular system Myocardial Infarction, Hypertension, Congestive Cardiac Failure.', '198\nOrientation Guidelines for Community Health Officers (CHOs)-Homoeopathy\nOthers Ophthalmic Senile Cataract, Presbyopia (refractive error), Dry eye syndrome, \nGlaucoma, Age related Macular Degeneration (ARMD).\nAuditory Impaired/ Loss of hearing (presbycussis).\nCancer Prostatic Cancer, Lung Cancer, Colon Cancer, Breast Cancer.\nGynecological Pelvic organ prolapse, Malignancies, Dry vagina.\nOthers Dental problems Loss of teeth, inability to chew which are potent cause of \nnutritional deficiencies, gastric problems.\n12.3 General principles of geriatric care\nThe following principles are helpful to keep in mind while caring for older adults:\no Many disorders are multifactorial in origin.\no Diseases often present atypically.\no Not all abnormalities require evaluation and treatment.\no Complex medication regimens, adherence problems, medication dependence, and \npolypharmacy are common challenges.\no Multiple chronic conditions often coexist and should be managed in concert with one \nanother.\nRisk of many malignancies increases with age. Multimorbidities are common and many old \nage persons are on multiple medications. Risk of fall and accidents is greater in old age due \nto joint deformities, lack of balance, multimorbidity conditions and medication use, further \ncompromising old age functioning.\nGeriatric care, therefore, encompasses an estimate of potential risk or mortality and increasing \nmorbidity in the aged person and a holistic treatment approach taking into consideration', 'weight and body mass index (BMI 20–27). If BMI >27, implement a 5–10% calorie restriction. \no Limit consumption of foods with high caloric density, high sugar, and high salt content \n(less than 6 g per day). \no Limit the intake of foods with a high content of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol. \no Limit alcohol consumption (1 drink per day or less). \no Older persons who have little exposure to UVB radiation are at risk of vitamin D insufficiency. \nThus, vitamin D–fortified foods and/or vitamin D supplements should be introduced in \nthe diet. \no Make sure that the diet includes adequate food-related intake of magnesium, vitamin A, \nand vitamin B12. \no For constipation: increase dietary fiber to 10–25 g and fluid intake to 1500 ml daily.\n12.7 Geriatric assessment\n• The rationale of geriatric assessment is to better recognize common geriatric disorders in \norder to improve functional outcomes and quality of life for older adults. \n• A number of simple geriatric screening instruments have been published for the purpose of \nincreasing the detection of common geriatric conditions. Few screening instruments which \nare easy to use, well accepted by practitioners and relatively quick to administer are:\n o For functional disability developed by Lachs et al.\n o Screening instrument by Moore et al.\n o Index of independence in ADLs.\n o Walking speed instrument.\n o Six minute walk test.\n o Short Physical Performance Battery.', 'Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment\nPart -1\nFor CHO/SN', 'intervention, and physical activities including yoga, lifestyle and behavioral \nchanges in favor of healthy ageing.

Declining fertility \nand increase in survival at older ages has resulted in the proportion of older people (60 \nyears and above) in general population increasing substantially within a relatively short \nperiod of time. India recorded a significant improvement in life expectancy at birth, \nwhich was 47 years in 1969, growing to 60 years in 1994 and 69 years in 2019\n1.\nThe share of population of elderly was 8% in 2015 i.e. 106 million (10 crores plus) \nacross the nation, making India the second largest global population of elderly citizens. \nFurther, it has been projected that by 2050 the elderly population will increase to 19%\n2\nii) As the elderly population continues to grow, elderly dependency ratio will rise \ndramatically from 0.12 to 0.31. Gender disparity has also been reported with 50% of \nwomen aged 75 years and older report difficulty with at least one Activity of Daily. Life \n(ADL) compared to only 24% of men, adding the focus towards female elderly care\n3.\niii) Elderly populations have varying and complex social and health-care needs. For \nexample, while dementia maybe addressed with health inputs, the social and financial \ninsecurities that may co-exist require inputs from the social welfare and finance sectors. \nA multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach, comprising professionals and general', '2\na framework to create an enabling environment for “Society for all Ages”. It also \npromotes the concept of Active and Healthy Ageing. It also strives to deliver all round \ncare by strengthening the convergence between various in line departments i.e. Ministry \nof Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Social Justice and \nEmpowerment, Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Urban Development etc. \nKeeping in the view the exponential increase in the elderly population & requirement of \nproviding multidisciplinary care to elderly the NPHCE strives to undertake a paradigm \nshift from provision of segregated Geriatric OPD, IPD, Physiotherapy services to \ndelivery of Comprehensive Geriatric Care.\nvi) The Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI) Wave 1, 2017-18, launched under the \naegis of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has enabled better understanding of \nIndia’s elderly health problems. The self reported prevalence of cardiaovascular disease \nwas 34% among those in age 60-74 which increases to 37% among those age 75 \nand above. 32%of the elderly reported hypertension, 14.2% reported diabetes, 4.7% \nreported anemia, 8.3% reported chronic lung disease, 5.9% reported asthma, 2.6% \nreported neurological and psychiatric problems,55.3% reported vision related problems, \n9.6% reported ear related problems. A higher proportion of elderly age 60 and above \nexperienced difficulty in stooping, kneeling, or crouching (58%), followed by difficulty', 'the functional ability in elderly to enable wellbeing. The concept of healthy ageing \nfocuses on both intrinsic capacity as well as functional ability of elderly population. \nThe concept of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment takes in to account both intrinsic \ncapacity and functional ability.\nviii) The guidelines on Elderly care at Health and Wellness Centres envisage strengthening \nof healthcare delivery for elderly patients in both rural and urban areas and to be \nincluded in the set of services being offered as part of Comprehensive Primary Health \nCare.

Fig 4: Role of CHO in safe abortion services
• CHO should support the ASHA and MPW of the SHC-HWC to increase awareness in the community regarding 
risks and consequences of adolescent pregnancy, childbirth, and unsafe abortions.
• Provide easily available, friendly, non-judgemental, confidential family planning, counselling, and services.
• Recognition of signs and symptoms of abortion complications (heavy bright red vaginal bleeding with or 
without clots, pallor etc).
• Refer to appropriate referral site for safe abortion services. For medical method of abortion up to 7 weeks refer 
to PHC-MO and to CHC/DH if pregnancy is 8 weeks to 20 weeks.
• With approval of two registered medical practitioners, termination of pregnancies can be done between 20 to 
24 weeks.  The termination of pregnancies up to 24 weeks will only apply to specific categories of women, as 
may be prescribed by the government guidelines.
• Follow up for any post abortion complications and refer to higher facility if needed.
• Provide post abortion contraceptive counselling.

Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)
Due to high-risk sexual behaviour, young generation face the risk of RTIs and STIs like HIV-AIDS. Many 
adolescents engage in sexual intercourse with multiple partners without contraceptives, placing them 
at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections, including herpes genitals, syphilis, gonorrhoea, 
chancroid, genital warts, and HIV.
Consequences of Unsafe Sexual Behaviour among Adolescents
 ● Early pregnancy and parenthood
 ● Higher percentage of Low Birth Weight (LBW) babies and increased infant morbidity and mortality
 ● Abortions and its related complications
 ● RTI/STI including HIV/AIDS
Consequences that are higher in adolescents even if it has been ‘safe sex’
 ● Emotional impact – guilt, stress, anxiety, suicide
 ● Social impact – stigma
 ● Economic impact – hindrance to academic and career progression
RTI is an infection of the genital tract. The infection can affect vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, tubes, and 
ovaries in women. Infection of uterus and the tube, known as Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases (PID), can 
result in infertility. RTIs include all infections of the reproductive tract, whether transmitted sexually or 
not.
STI is transmitted from one person to another primarily by sexual contact. Some STIs can be transmitted 
by exposure to contaminated blood, or from a mother to her unborn child. This is a major public health 
problem for two reasons:

STI is transmitted from one person to another primarily by sexual contact. Some STIs can be transmitted 
by exposure to contaminated blood, or from a mother to her unborn child. This is a major public health 
problem for two reasons:
 ● It is common among adolescents to go to untrained and unskilled providers especially when they 
are unmarried, or if married and the pregnancy is unintended, the adolescent wants to get rid of it 
clandestinely (without informing the in-laws). The younger they are, it is more likely that they will be 
forced to opt for a potentially unsafe abortion conducted in an unhygienic condition by an unskilled 
provider.
 ● There is a general lack of awareness among adolescents about the ‘Medical Termination of Pregnancy’ 
that can be availed at registered health facilities. These are inaccessible because of the family’s need 
for secrecy, confidentiality, and pressure from societal and community demands.
 ● Use of dangerous methods are also common in adolescents, especially unmarried girls who are 
advised by mothers, untrained birth attendants, quacks, to insert foreign bodies (sticks, roots etc.) into 
the cervix un-hygienically or ingest certain potions or drugs.
 ● Even after a spontaneous abortion, an adolescent may have post abortion complications, if the 
abortion is not complete or some infection has occurred or unhygienic practices were followed.",63.90547752380371,3358.320713043213,10,Hybrid (alpha=0.8)

Types of anemia:
1. Nutritional Anemia: It is caused due to deficiency of micro-nutrient such as minerals (iron, zinc, 
copper, selenium etc.) and vitamins (Folic acid, Vit B12, Vit B6)
2. Non-nutritional Anemia:  Due to hemoglobinopathies (thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), Soil 
Transmitted helminths inflammation, fluorosis and malaria and diseases such as tuberculosis etc.
Nutritional Anemia:
In nutritional anemia, due to the decrease in haemoglobin level below normal (Hb less than 12gm %), 
every tissue cell suffers from lack of oxygen.  Grading of anemia as per WHO is as mentioned in Table 8
Table 8: Grading of anemia
Population Anemia
Mild Moderate Severe
Adolescent girls 10-19 years  10.0-11.9 gm/dl 7-9.9 gm/dl <7gm/dl
Adolescent boys 10-19 years 12-12.9 gm/dl 9.0-11.9 gm/dl < 9 gm/dl
The cause, signs, and symptoms of nutritional anemia is as under
Table 9: Causes, sign and symptoms of Nutritional Anemia
Causes Signs and symptoms
• Inadequate intake of the dietary iron.
• Improper absorption of iron.
• Loss of iron from the body.
• Worm infestations.
• Tiredness and weakness.
• Breathlessness.
• Pale face, nails, tongue, and conjunctiva of eyes.
• Lack of concentration:
  Reduces capacity to work thus decreased productivity.
  Limit learning ability.
  Causes loss of appetite.
  Affects the growth and development.

  Limit learning ability.
  Causes loss of appetite.
  Affects the growth and development.
  Increases vulnerability to infections due to decrease in 
immunity.
Anemia in girls has deleterious consequences. Anemic girls on entering the reproductive age, will have 
lower pre-pregnancy iron stores and are at an increased risk of giving birth to pre-term newborns, babies 
with a low birth weight (below 2,500 grams) and have complications during child birth. 
Non-nutritional anemia:
Non-nutritional anemia can be due to chronic blood loss in conditions such as heavy menstruation 
and/or hemorrhoids. Non-nutritional anemia can also be due to hemoglobinopathies such as sickle 
cell disease and thalassemia. In areas endemic for malaria, fluorosis and haemoglobinopathies, non-
nutritional anemia is a common finding. 
In the endemic areas, special focus should be given to integrate screening and treatment of anemia, 
along with screening and treatment of malaria, haemoglobinopathies and fluorosis, respectively.
Prevention & Control of anemia: Intake of adequate and balanced nutrition will cover all the required 
nutrients to prevent nutritional anemia.

1. Location: All the guidelines as below
2. Area of the Building: The building area must be well planned with the entire necessary infrastructure, including electricity, all weather road communication, adequate water supply, telephone etc.
3. Number of Beds: 30 indoor beds

The CHC should be away from garbage collection, cattle shed, water logging area, and other areas that could cause pollution or harm to patients. The CHC must also avoid being in the vicinity of any areas where there are significant risks of accidents such as livestock sheds, waterlogging areas, etc.

It is important for the CHC to have a well-lit and ventilated building with adequate natural light and ventilation. The building should be well planned with all necessary infrastructure and facilities. It must also be well lit and ventilated with as much use of natural light and ventilation as possible.

The CHC should not be located in areas where there are garbage collection points, cattle sheds, or water logging areas. The CHC should have a designated area for waste disposal outside the building to ensure that patients do not come into contact with contaminated materials.

However, in certain states, the sub health centre is linked directly to the Community \nHealth Centre (CHC) at the block level (which in some blocks is a role performed by the Block PHC). Across \nall contexts however, it must be ensured that administrative, technical/mentoring and referral support be \nprovided by a MBBS Medical Officer in a facility that is in geographic proximity to the cluster of HWCs and is \nequipped to manage referral support for HWC. This could therefore be either a PHC or a CHC.', 'As envisaged under National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), the public health institutions in rural \nareas are to be upgraded from its present level to a level of a set of standards called “Indian \nPublic Health Standards (IPHS)”. The Indian Public Health Standards are the benchmarks for \nquality expected from various components of Public health care organizations and may be used \nfor assessing performance of health care delivery system. \nThe Community Health Centres (CHCs) which constitute the secondary level of health care \nwere designed to provide referral as well as specialist health care to the rural population. \nIndian Public Health Standards (IPHS) for CHCs were first released under National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) in \x08\nearly 2007.\nAs setting standards is a dynamic process, need was felt to update the IPHS keeping in view the changing protocols \nof existing National Health Programmes, development of new programmes especially for non-communicable \ndiseases and the prevailing epidemiological situation in the country. The IPHS for CHC has been revised by a task \nforce comprising of various stakeholders under the Chairmanship of Director General of Health Services. Subject \nexperts, NGOs, State representatives and health workers working in the health facilities have also been consulted \nat different stages of revision. \nThe newly revised IPHS (CHC) has considered the services, infrastructure, manpower, equipment and drugs in two', 'PREFACE\nStandards are a means of describing a level of quality that the health care organizations are \nexpected to meet or aspire to achieve. For the first time under National Rural Health Mission \n(NRHM), an effort had been made to develop Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) for a vast \nnetwork of peripheral public health institutions in the country and the first set of standards was \nreleased in early 2007 to provide optimal specialized care to the community and achieve and \nmaintain an acceptable standard of quality of care. \nThe IPHS for Community Health Centres has been revised keeping in view the resources \navailable with respect to functional requirements for a Community Health Centre with minimum standards for \nsuch as building, manpower, instruments and equipment, drugs and other facilities etc. The revised IPHS has \nalso incorporated the changed protocols of the existing health programmes and new programmes and initiatives \nespecially in respect of Non-Communicable Diseases. The task of revision was completed as a result of consultations \nheld over many months with task force members, programme officers, Regional Directors of Health and Family \nWelfare, experts, health functionaries, representatives of Non-Government organizations, development partners \nand State/Union Territory Government representatives after reaching a consensus. The contribution of all of them', 'MESSAGE \nNational Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched to strengthen the Rural Public Health \nSystem and has since met many hopes and expectations. The Mission seeks to provide effective \nhealth care to the rural populace throughout the country with special focus on the States and \nUnion Territories (UTs), which have weak public health indicators and/or weak infrastructure.\nTowards this end, the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) for Sub-Centres, Primary Health \nCentres (PHCs), Community Health Centres (CHCs), Sub-District and District Hospitals were \npublished in January/February, 2007 and have been used as the reference point for public health \ncare infrastructure planning and up-gradation in the States and UTs. IPHS are a set of uniform standards envisaged \nto improve the quality of health care delivery in the country.\nThe IPHS documents have been revised keeping in view the changing protocols of the existing programmes and \nintroduction of new programmes especially for Non-Communicable Diseases. Flexibility is allowed to suit the \ndiverse needs of the states and regions.\nOur country has a large number of public health institutions in rural areas from sub-centres at the most peripheral \nlevel to the district hospitals at the district level. It is highly desirable that they should be fully functional and deliver \nquality care. I strongly believe that these IPHS guidelines will act as the main driver for continuous improvement in']","STATE HEALTH PROFILE

In the former, the \npain is associated with a specific cause such as cancer. With chronic non-malignant pain, the original tissue \ninjury present but not progressive or has been healed. Identifying an organic cause for this type of chronic pain is \nmore difficult.\nChronic pain differs, from acute pain in that it is harder for the patient to provide specific information about the \nlocation and the intensity of the pain. Over time it becomes more difficult for the patient to differentiate the exact \nlocation of the pain and identify the intensity of the pain. The patient with chronic pain often does not present \nwith behaviours and physiological changes associated with acute pain.\n47', 'Training Manual on Palliative Care for Community Health Officer\nat Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres \nPREAMBLE\nWith the National Health Policy of 2017, India took a giant step towards a Healthier India.\nHealth is defined as “a state of complete physical, social and mental well-being and not merely the absence \nof disease or infirmity.”\nThe conventional health care system concentrates on prevention, diagnosis and cure of diseases.  \nUnfortunately, this often leaves suffering unattended.  It is estimated that at least 10 million Indians are in \nserious health-related suffering every year.\nThe suffering can be because of pain and other symptoms or because of social, mental or spiritual issues.  \nPalliative care addresses serious health-related suffering in all these domains. Understandably, dealing \nwith these necessitates are multidiciplinary teamwork. There is something for everyone to do, including the \npatient and family, the community around them and all participants in health care delivery.\nIf we are to prevent and treat suffering, the application of palliative care has to happen all through the course \nof the disease from the time the suffering starts, which can even be before the time of diagnosis.

What is the recommended schedule for testing Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) in pregnant women?,"Based solely on the provided context from the CHO training materials, the recommended schedule for testing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in pregnant women is as follows:

1. **First Test**: The first test should be conducted during first antenatal contact as early as possible in pregnancy. This means that if a woman comes late to her ANC at the time of first contact, she will only need to undergo one test.

2. **Second Test**: If the first test is negative, the second test should be done 24-28 weeks of pregnancy. 

3. **Third Test**: If both tests are negative, the woman should be referred to the PHC-MO (Public Health Care Office) for further evaluation and management.

The context does not specify a specific time frame or frequency at which these tests need to be conducted, but it clearly indicates that GDM testing is part of routine ANC (Antenatal Check-Up) procedures. The goal is to diagnose women with gestational diabetes early in pregnancy so they can receive appropriate treatment and management.

It's important to note that the context does not provide specific details about how often these tests are conducted or what happens after a positive result, but it clearly outlines the guidelines for testing GDM during ANC.","['followed up for treatment.\nUrine Test for the presence of sugar To diagnose women with gestational diabetes\nGestational diabetes (GDM) is a \ncondition of high blood glucose levels \namong women during pregnancy.

Adolescent immunization 
Under Universal Immunization Program (UIP), adolescents aged 10 years and 16 years are to be vaccinated 
with Tetanus and adult Diphtheria (Td) vaccine as per national immunization schedule (annexure). 
Different strategies are being followed in the states to optimise adolescent immunization with Td10 and 
Td16 vaccination:
1. Convergence with Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) programme to improve Td10 and Td16 
coverage mainly at schools.
2. Using VHSNDs and UHSNDs to provide Td10 and Td16 vaccination for out of school children.
3. Organize Td immunization week (s) to improve Td10 and Td16 coverage.

3. Organize Td immunization week (s) to improve Td10 and Td16 coverage.
4. School-going adolescents of class 5 and class 10 can be vaccinated using platforms like School Health 
program (SHP), RBSK as well as by carrying out Td adolescent immunization week once every year. 
Out of school adolescents can be vaccinated by strengthening the existing routine immunization 
platforms under VHSND. 
Depending on the feasibility and states’ prerogative, a combination of the strategies is also being used 
for more effective coverage outcomes.
Key Strategic Components
1. Microplanning: Comprehensive microplanning is the basis for delivery of quality immunization 
services to the community. The availability of updated and complete microplans at a planning unit 
(urban/rural) demonstrates preparedness of a unit and directly affects the quality of services provided. 
Microplans are prepared for a one-year period but must be reviewed every quarter. For Td vaccination 
two types of microplans need to be prepared: (a) for School going and (b) for out of school adolescents. 
Specific components of a RI micro plan for Td immunization include:
 ● Enlisting of all villages/wards/tolas/HRAs
 ● Estimation of the target population:

What is the 'Nishchay' kit used for in the context of maternal health?,"In the context provided, the ""Nishchay"" kit is specifically mentioned as being used for detecting pregnancy. The text states that under this scheme, ASHA (the service provider) regularly collects Nishchay kits from sub-centers and provides them to women for detection of pregnancy. This kit serves multiple purposes:

1. **Detection of Pregnancy**: It helps in identifying the presence of a developing fetus by collecting samples of blood and urine.

2. **Early Detection**: The kit is used to detect early signs of pregnancy, such as changes in menstrual cycle or symptoms like nausea and vomiting.

3. **Monitoring**: After the first trimester, ASHA monitors the woman's health through regular check-ups and provides guidance on safe practices for motherhood.

4. **Support Services**: It also offers support services such as counseling, education, and transportation to help women navigate their pregnancy journey safely.

5. **Documentation**: The kit is used to track the progress of pregnancies, which can be useful in managing obstetric complications or ensuring proper delivery planning.

Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs):
Across the country in the past two 
decades, people have experienced 
a dramatic change in the pattern 
of diseases. There is a declining 
trend in infectious (communicable) 
diseases and a steady rise in the 
so-called lifestyle diseases or non-
communicable diseases. 
Diet and lifestyle are two major factors 
thought to influence susceptibility 
to many diseases. Drug abuse, 
tobacco use, smoking and alcohol 
consumption, as well as lack of exercise 
may increase the risk of developing 
certain diseases in later part of life.  
There is greater rate of obesity due 
to sedentary lifestyles, more time on 
computers/phones and increased 
intake of high energy sugary and fried

19 years nearly 2 per 1000 girls and 1 per 1000 boys suffer from diabetes (NFHS-3).
Adolescence provides an opportune time for positive behaviour modification, to mitigate the emergence 
of risk factors of NCDs. The main preventable risk factors for NCDs such as tobacco and alcohol 
consumption, poor dietary habits, sedentary lifestyle, and stress have their beginnings often in this age 
group. So, it is imperative to initiate the promotion of healthy lifestyle habits at a younger age to prevent 
NCDs.

consumption, poor dietary habits, sedentary lifestyle, and stress have their beginnings often in this age 
group. So, it is imperative to initiate the promotion of healthy lifestyle habits at a younger age to prevent 
NCDs. 
Nutrition during adolescence 
Adolescence is a significant period for physical growth and sexual maturation. Nutrition being an 
important determinant of physical and mental growth of adolescents as an important area that needs 
attention. 
Inadequate nutritional intake during adolescence can have serious consequences throughout the 
reproductive years and beyond. Poor nutrition during adolescence can impair the work capacity and 
productivity of adolescent boys and girls in their later years. Further, an undernourished girl is at the risk 
of developing complications during pregnancy and the chances of her giving birth to a low-birth-weight 
baby increases, thus perpetuating a vicious cycle of malnutrition and ill-health, and an intergenerational 
effect. 
About half of the adolescent girls (15-19 years) suffer from anemia (NFHS-4). 42% of adolecent girls and 
45% of adolescent boys of the same age group are reported to have Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5 
(NFHS-4). Iodine Deficiency Disorders can lead to growth retardation, delayed puberty and menarche, 
juvenile hypothyroidism etc. Missing meals, eating junk food and food fads are equal in rural and urban

(NFHS-4). Iodine Deficiency Disorders can lead to growth retardation, delayed puberty and menarche, 
juvenile hypothyroidism etc. Missing meals, eating junk food and food fads are equal in rural and urban 
areas among adolescents, affecting their health adversely. This is driven by fancy towards role models 
and publicity from the food industry. 
Balanced Diet 
A balanced diet is one that provides all nutrients in required quantity and proportions for maintaining 
health and general well-being and makes a small provision for extra nutrients to withstand short duration 
of illness. It can be achieved through a blend of the basic food groups namely carbohydrates, proteins, 
fats, vitamins, and minerals. As these are present in different types of food items like pulses, cereals and 
millets, green vegetables and milk, egg, fish, meat etc., it is important to eat these food items in the right 
mix every day.",80.69825172424316,2533.022880554199,10,Hybrid (alpha=0.8)

What are the symptoms of Presbyopia in the elderly?,"Presbyopia is a common eye disorder that affects people over 40 years old. It occurs when the eye cannot clearly focus images from the outside world as well as it should. The symptoms of presbyopia include difficulty in seeing distant objects clearly and blurring of vision on reading or doing close work, which improves if the person holds books further away.

The examination of refractive errors includes measuring visual acuity with Snellen's test types at 6 meters. If a patient cannot see the top line from 6 meters, they are asked to slowly walk towards the chart until they can read it again. The vision is recorded as 5/60, 4/60, 3/69, 2/60 and 1/60 respectively.

The symptoms of presbyopia include:

- Reduced visual acuity for distance but near objects can be seen clearly
- Usually there is no headache. Person may squint their eyes to see at a distance.
- Osteoporosis itself has no specific symptoms; in fact the first manifestation of the illness may be - o Hip, spine or wrist fractures
- External rotation and shortening of the involved leg
- Delayed fracture healing process

The main features suggesting presbyopia are:

1. Myopia (nearsightedness): difficulty in seeing distant objects clearly
2. Hypermetropia (farsightedness): difficulty in seeing close objects clearly
3. Astigmatism: distorted vision resulting from an irregularly curved cornea
4. Presbyopia: which leads to difficulty in reading or seeing at arm's length, it is linked to age and occurs almost universally with increasing age.

The most common cause of presbyopia is aging, but other factors such as exposure to sunlight, poor nutrition, and certain medical conditions can also contribute to the development of this eye disorder.","['163\nCommon Ophthalmic, ENT and Oral Health Issues\nThere is initially not much complaint of distant vision as that can be corrected by exerting \naccommodation. But there is difficulty in doing close work and letters become blurred after \nsome time of reading due to fatigue of accommodation. Headache is a usual symptom.\nAstigmatism \nThere is diminished visual acuity and headache ue to exertion of accommodation. \nPresbyopia \nUsually seen after the age of 40 years when least distance of distinct vision of 25 cm recedes and \nperson complains of blurring of vision on reading or doing close work which improves if book/ \nwork is held further away from the eye. Appearance of symptoms may appear earlier in persons \ndoing more of close work or in hypermetropes. It may not be there is myopes. \nExamination of Refractive Errors\n•\t Visual Acuity is determined, both uniocularly and binocularly. Distant Visual Acuity is \nmeasured by Snellen’s test typesIt consists of a series of black capital letters on a white \nboard, arranged in lines, each progressively diminishing in size.\n•\t Depending on the smallest line which the patient can read from a distance of 6 metres, his/\nher vision is recorded as 6/6, 6/9, 6/12, 6/18, 6/24, 6/36 and 6/60 respectively.\n•\t If he/she cannot see the top line from 6 m, he/she is asked to slowly walk towards the chart \ntill he/she can read the top line, his vision is recorded as 5/60, 4/60, 3/69, 2/60 and 1/60 \nrespectively.', '•\t Sicca (i.e. dry eye syndromes)\n11.1.2 Refractive errors\nA refractive error is a very common eye disorder.

What is the formula for calculating the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) based on the Last Menstrual Period (LMP)?,"Based on the information provided in the context, the formula for calculating the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) is:

EDD = Date of LMP + 9 months + 7 days

This means that to calculate the EDD, you need to add 9 months and then add 7 days to the date of the last menstrual period (LMP).","['15\nResult: \n ∙ If one red band appears in the result window ‘R’, the pregnancy test is negative.\n ∙ If two parallel red bands appear, the pregnancy test is positive.\nc. Determining LMP and EDD:\n ∙ As a first step you would take the menstrual history to calculate \nthe EDD and prepare a birth plan.\n ∙ Recall that the LMP refers to the FIRST day of the woman’s last \nmenstrual period.\n ∙ Make sure that the woman is not referring to the date of the first \nmissed period, i.e., the date when menstruation was expected to \noccur the following month and failed to occur.\n ∙ If the woman is unable to remember the exact date, encourage \nher to remember some major event,festival, or occurrence which \nshe might link with her LMP.\n ∙ If the exact date of the LMP is not known and it is late in the pregnancy, ask for the date when the foetal \nmovements were first felt. This is known as ‘quickening’ and is felt at around 20 weeks of gestation. This \ninformation would give a rough idea about the period of gestation, which needs to be correlated with the \nfundal height to estimate the gestational age.\n ∙ Calculate the EDD using the formula in box. It is based on the assumption that the menstrual cycle of the \nwoman was regular before conception and that it was a 28–30 days’ cycle.\nEDD = Date of LMP + 9 months + 7 days\nd.

Schedule of Antenatal visits and Timing of Registration:\n ∙ The first visit or registration of a pregnant woman for ANC should take place as soon as the pregnancy is \nsuspected, and you would need to ensure that ASHAs and MPWs are able to register all pregnant women \nfrom the HWC service area.\n ∙ Including the registration, four antenatal check-ups should be ensured for every pregnant woman as per the \nschedule below:\nNo. of Visit Timings of Visit\n1st Visit Within 12 weeks, preferably as soon as pregnancy is suspected\n2nd Visit Between 14-26 weeks\n3rd Visit Between 28-36 weeks\n4th Visit Between 36 weeks and term\nPMSMA check-up In 2nd or 3rd trimester\nAs a CHO, under PMSMA you will need to:\n ∙ Follow up with ASHAs to ensure that at least one ANC is conducted by the Medical Officer of the PHC.\n ∙ Inform and refer the mother to avail ANC check-ups as part of the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva \nAbhiyan.

Malnutrition:
Nutrition influences growth and development throughout infancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is, 
however, during the period of adolescence that nutrient needs are the greatest. 
Malnutrition can be classified as under-nutrition, over-nutrition (overweight and obesity), and 
micronutrient deficiency. Under-nutrition is when someone is not getting enough calories or nutrients; 
it can be due to either an insufficient diet or a problem in assimilating nutrients. Over-nutrition occurs 
when too many nutrients are ingested. Deficiency of micronutrients such as vitamins, iron, calcium, zinc, 
etc. affects body’s immune system. All types of malnutrition can lead to serious health problems which 
can be fatal.
The signs and symptoms of malnutrition include:
 ● Fatigue and low energy
 ● Problems with learning
 ● Bloated stomach
 ● Slowed reaction times and trouble paying attention

etc. affects body’s immune system. All types of malnutrition can lead to serious health problems which 
can be fatal.
The signs and symptoms of malnutrition include:
 ● Fatigue and low energy
 ● Problems with learning
 ● Bloated stomach
 ● Slowed reaction times and trouble paying attention
 ● Dizziness
 ● Poor immune function (which leads to frequent illnesses in the adolescent)
 ● Dry, scaly skin, swollen and bleeding gums
 ● Decaying teeth
 ● Underweight and poor growth
 ● Muscle weakness and bones that break easily
Management of Nutrition
Nutrition Assessment and Counselling in adolescents 
Nutritional assessment is an important part of evaluation of an adolescent. A stepwise approach should 
be adopted. 
Step 1: History - Nutritional history in adolescence 
History about foods and eating habits should be taken primarily from the adolescent alone, and from 
parents also but separately. This is important as adolescent may not reveal some of the eating behaviours 
in front of the parents. It should be clarified to the adolescent that the purpose is to find out problem 
areas and not to find faults in them. In nutritional history, all details about food pattern, past and present 
illness, daily physical activities should be noted. You can refer RKSK resource book for medical officer for 
detail.

What is Sarcopenia in the context of elderly health?,"Sarcopenia refers to the loss or deterioration of muscle mass and strength associated with aging. It occurs due to several factors, including age-related decline in motor neurons that control muscle function, hormonal changes, genetic predisposition, and environmental stressors such as lack of exercise and diet quality.
The term ""sarcopenia"" was first coined by Dr. John Sartorius in 1975, who described it as a condition characterized by the loss or deterioration of muscle mass and strength with age. This decline is often referred to as ""atrophy"" or ""wasting.""
Sarcopenia can lead to several physical challenges for older adults, including reduced mobility, decreased strength, and increased susceptibility to injuries. It has been linked to various health problems, such as osteoporosis, falls, and cognitive impairment.
The exact causes of sarcopenia are not fully understood, but it is believed to be a multifactorial process involving genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and lifestyle choices. Some studies have suggested that sarcopenia may be more common in older adults who engage in sedentary activities or those with certain medical conditions.
Treatment options for sarcopenia include physical therapy, strength training exercises, dietary changes, and medication. In some cases, surgical interventions such as muscle transplants or muscle repair procedures may also be considered.
Sarcopenia is a significant concern for older adults and can have a significant impact on their quality of life and overall health. It is important to recognize the signs and symptoms of sarcopenia and take steps to prevent its progression and effects on physical function.","['Older age group categories \nCategory Age Group (years)\nElderly (Older persons) 65+ (sometimes 60+)\nOldest-old 80+\n12.2 Common diseases of Geriatrics\nOrgan System Ailments\nCardiovascular system Myocardial Infarction, Hypertension, Congestive Cardiac Failure.\nRespiratory system Bronchial Asthma, Chronic Bronchitis, Snoring, COPD, Pneumonia, Acute \nbronchitis.\nMusculoskeletal system Osteoarthritis with joint deformities and reduced flexibility, Osteoporosis, Muscle \nweakness/ spasm, Fractures esp. colle’s fracture and hip bone fracture (neck of \nfemur).\nGastro-Intestinal system Dyspepsia, flatulence, Constipation, hernias.\nGenito-Urinary system Chronic balanitis and penile cancer, Prostate enlargement, Cancer of prostate, \nBladder incontenance.\nEndocrinal system Diabetes Mellitus\nNervous system Stroke, Senile Dementia, Parkinson’s Disease, Depression, Insomnia.\nSkin and its appendages Skin dryness, Hair loss & baldness.', '197\nGeriatric and Palliative Care\nCHAPTER 12\nGERIATRIC AND PALLIATIVE CARE\n12.1 Introduction\nGeriatrics is the branch of medicine concerned with the medical problems and care of the aged. \n[Geras=old age + iatrikas=healing]. The speciality of geriatric medicine is defined less in terms \nof the diseases it treats than in the range of responsibility it accepts. This responsibility embraces \npreventive care, health promotion, and diagnosis and treatment of acute illness followed by \nrehabilitation and resettlement of patients in the community. Ageing, in the sense of senescence, \nis a progressive loss of adaptability of an individual as time passes. As individuals, we age at \ndifferent rates and with different patterns. Primary ageing is the product of interactions between \nintrinsic, genetically determined factors and extrinsic factors in lifestyle and environment.\nBased on the physical capacity to work, the old are placed in three categories:\n o Recent old who are still active and undertake normal activities without support.\n o Old who work with difficulty and hence have reduced activities.\n o Very old who work with difficulty in home or cannot work at all.\nOlder age group categories \nCategory Age Group (years)\nElderly (Older persons) 65+ (sometimes 60+)\nOldest-old 80+\n12.2 Common diseases of Geriatrics\nOrgan System Ailments\nCardiovascular system Myocardial Infarction, Hypertension, Congestive Cardiac Failure.', '198\nOrientation Guidelines for Community Health Officers (CHOs)-Homoeopathy\nOthers Ophthalmic Senile Cataract, Presbyopia (refractive error), Dry eye syndrome, \nGlaucoma, Age related Macular Degeneration (ARMD).\nAuditory Impaired/ Loss of hearing (presbycussis).\nCancer Prostatic Cancer, Lung Cancer, Colon Cancer, Breast Cancer.\nGynecological Pelvic organ prolapse, Malignancies, Dry vagina.\nOthers Dental problems Loss of teeth, inability to chew which are potent cause of \nnutritional deficiencies, gastric problems.\n12.3 General principles of geriatric care\nThe following principles are helpful to keep in mind while caring for older adults:\no Many disorders are multifactorial in origin.\no Diseases often present atypically.\no Not all abnormalities require evaluation and treatment.\no Complex medication regimens, adherence problems, medication dependence, and \npolypharmacy are common challenges.\no Multiple chronic conditions often coexist and should be managed in concert with one \nanother.\nRisk of many malignancies increases with age. Multimorbidities are common and many old \nage persons are on multiple medications. Risk of fall and accidents is greater in old age due \nto joint deformities, lack of balance, multimorbidity conditions and medication use, further \ncompromising old age functioning.\nGeriatric care, therefore, encompasses an estimate of potential risk or mortality and increasing \nmorbidity in the aged person and a holistic treatment approach taking into consideration', 'weight and body mass index (BMI 20–27). If BMI >27, implement a 5–10% calorie restriction. \no Limit consumption of foods with high caloric density, high sugar, and high salt content \n(less than 6 g per day). \no Limit the intake of foods with a high content of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol. \no Limit alcohol consumption (1 drink per day or less). \no Older persons who have little exposure to UVB radiation are at risk of vitamin D insufficiency. \nThus, vitamin D–fortified foods and/or vitamin D supplements should be introduced in \nthe diet. \no Make sure that the diet includes adequate food-related intake of magnesium, vitamin A, \nand vitamin B12. \no For constipation: increase dietary fiber to 10–25 g and fluid intake to 1500 ml daily.\n12.7 Geriatric assessment\n• The rationale of geriatric assessment is to better recognize common geriatric disorders in \norder to improve functional outcomes and quality of life for older adults. \n• A number of simple geriatric screening instruments have been published for the purpose of \nincreasing the detection of common geriatric conditions. Few screening instruments which \nare easy to use, well accepted by practitioners and relatively quick to administer are:\n o For functional disability developed by Lachs et al.\n o Screening instrument by Moore et al.\n o Index of independence in ADLs.\n o Walking speed instrument.\n o Six minute walk test.\n o Short Physical Performance Battery.', 'Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment\nPart -1\nFor CHO/SN', 'intervention, and physical activities including yoga, lifestyle and behavioral \nchanges in favor of healthy ageing.

Declining fertility \nand increase in survival at older ages has resulted in the proportion of older people (60 \nyears and above) in general population increasing substantially within a relatively short \nperiod of time. India recorded a significant improvement in life expectancy at birth, \nwhich was 47 years in 1969, growing to 60 years in 1994 and 69 years in 2019\n1.\nThe share of population of elderly was 8% in 2015 i.e. 106 million (10 crores plus) \nacross the nation, making India the second largest global population of elderly citizens. \nFurther, it has been projected that by 2050 the elderly population will increase to 19%\n2\nii) As the elderly population continues to grow, elderly dependency ratio will rise \ndramatically from 0.12 to 0.31. Gender disparity has also been reported with 50% of \nwomen aged 75 years and older report difficulty with at least one Activity of Daily. Life \n(ADL) compared to only 24% of men, adding the focus towards female elderly care\n3.\niii) Elderly populations have varying and complex social and health-care needs. For \nexample, while dementia maybe addressed with health inputs, the social and financial \ninsecurities that may co-exist require inputs from the social welfare and finance sectors. \nA multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach, comprising professionals and general', '2\na framework to create an enabling environment for “Society for all Ages”. It also \npromotes the concept of Active and Healthy Ageing. It also strives to deliver all round \ncare by strengthening the convergence between various in line departments i.e. Ministry \nof Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Social Justice and \nEmpowerment, Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Urban Development etc. \nKeeping in the view the exponential increase in the elderly population & requirement of \nproviding multidisciplinary care to elderly the NPHCE strives to undertake a paradigm \nshift from provision of segregated Geriatric OPD, IPD, Physiotherapy services to \ndelivery of Comprehensive Geriatric Care.\nvi) The Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI) Wave 1, 2017-18, launched under the \naegis of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has enabled better understanding of \nIndia’s elderly health problems. The self reported prevalence of cardiaovascular disease \nwas 34% among those in age 60-74 which increases to 37% among those age 75 \nand above. 32%of the elderly reported hypertension, 14.2% reported diabetes, 4.7% \nreported anemia, 8.3% reported chronic lung disease, 5.9% reported asthma, 2.6% \nreported neurological and psychiatric problems,55.3% reported vision related problems, \n9.6% reported ear related problems. A higher proportion of elderly age 60 and above \nexperienced difficulty in stooping, kneeling, or crouching (58%), followed by difficulty', 'the functional ability in elderly to enable wellbeing. The concept of healthy ageing \nfocuses on both intrinsic capacity as well as functional ability of elderly population. \nThe concept of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment takes in to account both intrinsic \ncapacity and functional ability.\nviii) The guidelines on Elderly care at Health and Wellness Centres envisage strengthening \nof healthcare delivery for elderly patients in both rural and urban areas and to be \nincluded in the set of services being offered as part of Comprehensive Primary Health \nCare. This intervention would embody the objectives of NPHCE and deliver the \nComprehensive Geriatric Care Services at all HWC’s.']","9

Fig 4: Role of CHO in safe abortion services
• CHO should support the ASHA and MPW of the SHC-HWC to increase awareness in the community regarding 
risks and consequences of adolescent pregnancy, childbirth, and unsafe abortions.
• Provide easily available, friendly, non-judgemental, confidential family planning, counselling, and services.
• Recognition of signs and symptoms of abortion complications (heavy bright red vaginal bleeding with or 
without clots, pallor etc).
• Refer to appropriate referral site for safe abortion services. For medical method of abortion up to 7 weeks refer 
to PHC-MO and to CHC/DH if pregnancy is 8 weeks to 20 weeks.
• With approval of two registered medical practitioners, termination of pregnancies can be done between 20 to 
24 weeks.  The termination of pregnancies up to 24 weeks will only apply to specific categories of women, as 
may be prescribed by the government guidelines.
• Follow up for any post abortion complications and refer to higher facility if needed.
• Provide post abortion contraceptive counselling.

Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)
Due to high-risk sexual behaviour, young generation face the risk of RTIs and STIs like HIV-AIDS. Many 
adolescents engage in sexual intercourse with multiple partners without contraceptives, placing them 
at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections, including herpes genitals, syphilis, gonorrhoea, 
chancroid, genital warts, and HIV.
Consequences of Unsafe Sexual Behaviour among Adolescents
 ● Early pregnancy and parenthood
 ● Higher percentage of Low Birth Weight (LBW) babies and increased infant morbidity and mortality
 ● Abortions and its related complications
 ● RTI/STI including HIV/AIDS
Consequences that are higher in adolescents even if it has been ‘safe sex’
 ● Emotional impact – guilt, stress, anxiety, suicide
 ● Social impact – stigma
 ● Economic impact – hindrance to academic and career progression
RTI is an infection of the genital tract. The infection can affect vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, tubes, and 
ovaries in women. Infection of uterus and the tube, known as Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases (PID), can 
result in infertility. RTIs include all infections of the reproductive tract, whether transmitted sexually or 
not.
STI is transmitted from one person to another primarily by sexual contact. Some STIs can be transmitted 
by exposure to contaminated blood, or from a mother to her unborn child. This is a major public health 
problem for two reasons:

STI is transmitted from one person to another primarily by sexual contact. Some STIs can be transmitted 
by exposure to contaminated blood, or from a mother to her unborn child. This is a major public health 
problem for two reasons:
 ● It is common among adolescents to go to untrained and unskilled providers especially when they 
are unmarried, or if married and the pregnancy is unintended, the adolescent wants to get rid of it 
clandestinely (without informing the in-laws). The younger they are, it is more likely that they will be 
forced to opt for a potentially unsafe abortion conducted in an unhygienic condition by an unskilled 
provider.
 ● There is a general lack of awareness among adolescents about the ‘Medical Termination of Pregnancy’ 
that can be availed at registered health facilities. These are inaccessible because of the family’s need 
for secrecy, confidentiality, and pressure from societal and community demands.
 ● Use of dangerous methods are also common in adolescents, especially unmarried girls who are 
advised by mothers, untrained birth attendants, quacks, to insert foreign bodies (sticks, roots etc.) into 
the cervix un-hygienically or ingest certain potions or drugs.
 ● Even after a spontaneous abortion, an adolescent may have post abortion complications, if the 
abortion is not complete or some infection has occurred or unhygienic practices were followed.",65.6125545501709,2761.249780654907,10,FAISS (Dense)

Types of anemia:
1. Nutritional Anemia: It is caused due to deficiency of micro-nutrient such as minerals (iron, zinc, 
copper, selenium etc.) and vitamins (Folic acid, Vit B12, Vit B6)
2. Non-nutritional Anemia:  Due to hemoglobinopathies (thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), Soil 
Transmitted helminths inflammation, fluorosis and malaria and diseases such as tuberculosis etc.
Nutritional Anemia:
In nutritional anemia, due to the decrease in haemoglobin level below normal (Hb less than 12gm %), 
every tissue cell suffers from lack of oxygen.  Grading of anemia as per WHO is as mentioned in Table 8
Table 8: Grading of anemia
Population Anemia
Mild Moderate Severe
Adolescent girls 10-19 years  10.0-11.9 gm/dl 7-9.9 gm/dl <7gm/dl
Adolescent boys 10-19 years 12-12.9 gm/dl 9.0-11.9 gm/dl < 9 gm/dl
The cause, signs, and symptoms of nutritional anemia is as under
Table 9: Causes, sign and symptoms of Nutritional Anemia
Causes Signs and symptoms
• Inadequate intake of the dietary iron.
• Improper absorption of iron.
• Loss of iron from the body.
• Worm infestations.
• Tiredness and weakness.
• Breathlessness.
• Pale face, nails, tongue, and conjunctiva of eyes.
• Lack of concentration:
  Reduces capacity to work thus decreased productivity.
  Limit learning ability.
  Causes loss of appetite.
  Affects the growth and development.

  Limit learning ability.
  Causes loss of appetite.
  Affects the growth and development.
  Increases vulnerability to infections due to decrease in 
immunity.
Anemia in girls has deleterious consequences. Anemic girls on entering the reproductive age, will have 
lower pre-pregnancy iron stores and are at an increased risk of giving birth to pre-term newborns, babies 
with a low birth weight (below 2,500 grams) and have complications during child birth. 
Non-nutritional anemia:
Non-nutritional anemia can be due to chronic blood loss in conditions such as heavy menstruation 
and/or hemorrhoids. Non-nutritional anemia can also be due to hemoglobinopathies such as sickle 
cell disease and thalassemia. In areas endemic for malaria, fluorosis and haemoglobinopathies, non-
nutritional anemia is a common finding. 
In the endemic areas, special focus should be given to integrate screening and treatment of anemia, 
along with screening and treatment of malaria, haemoglobinopathies and fluorosis, respectively.
Prevention & Control of anemia: Intake of adequate and balanced nutrition will cover all the required 
nutrients to prevent nutritional anemia.
Sources of dietary iron: Iron from food comes in two forms: heme and non-heme. Heme is found only

Prevention & Control of anemia: Intake of adequate and balanced nutrition will cover all the required

The Indian Public Health Standards are the benchmarks for \nquality expected from various components of Public health care organizations and may be used \nfor assessing performance of health care delivery system. \nThe Community Health Centres (CHCs) which constitute the secondary level of health care \nwere designed to provide referral as well as specialist health care to the rural population. \nIndian Public Health Standards (IPHS) for CHCs were first released under National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) in \x08\nearly 2007.\nAs setting standards is a dynamic process, need was felt to update the IPHS keeping in view the changing protocols \nof existing National Health Programmes, development of new programmes especially for non-communicable \ndiseases and the prevailing epidemiological situation in the country. The IPHS for CHC has been revised by a task \nforce comprising of various stakeholders under the Chairmanship of Director General of Health Services. Subject \nexperts, NGOs, State representatives and health workers working in the health facilities have also been consulted \nat different stages of revision. \nThe newly revised IPHS (CHC) has considered the services, infrastructure, manpower, equipment and drugs in two', 'PREFACE\nStandards are a means of describing a level of quality that the health care organizations are \nexpected to meet or aspire to achieve. For the first time under National Rural Health Mission \n(NRHM), an effort had been made to develop Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) for a vast \nnetwork of peripheral public health institutions in the country and the first set of standards was \nreleased in early 2007 to provide optimal specialized care to the community and achieve and \nmaintain an acceptable standard of quality of care. \nThe IPHS for Community Health Centres has been revised keeping in view the resources \navailable with respect to functional requirements for a Community Health Centre with minimum standards for \nsuch as building, manpower, instruments and equipment, drugs and other facilities etc. The revised IPHS has \nalso incorporated the changed protocols of the existing health programmes and new programmes and initiatives \nespecially in respect of Non-Communicable Diseases. The task of revision was completed as a result of consultations \nheld over many months with task force members, programme officers, Regional Directors of Health and Family \nWelfare, experts, health functionaries, representatives of Non-Government organizations, development partners \nand State/Union Territory Government representatives after reaching a consensus.

However, in certain states, the sub health centre is linked directly to the Community \nHealth Centre (CHC) at the block level (which in some blocks is a role performed by the Block PHC). Across \nall contexts however, it must be ensured that administrative, technical/mentoring and referral support be \nprovided by a MBBS Medical Officer in a facility that is in geographic proximity to the cluster of HWCs and is \nequipped to manage referral support for HWC. This could therefore be either a PHC or a CHC.', 'MESSAGE \nNational Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched to strengthen the Rural Public Health \nSystem and has since met many hopes and expectations. The Mission seeks to provide effective \nhealth care to the rural populace throughout the country with special focus on the States and \nUnion Territories (UTs), which have weak public health indicators and/or weak infrastructure.\nTowards this end, the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) for Sub-Centres, Primary Health \nCentres (PHCs), Community Health Centres (CHCs), Sub-District and District Hospitals were \npublished in January/February, 2007 and have been used as the reference point for public health \ncare infrastructure planning and up-gradation in the States and UTs. IPHS are a set of uniform standards envisaged \nto improve the quality of health care delivery in the country.\nThe IPHS documents have been revised keeping in view the changing protocols of the existing programmes and \nintroduction of new programmes especially for Non-Communicable Diseases. Flexibility is allowed to suit the \ndiverse needs of the states and regions.\nOur country has a large number of public health institutions in rural areas from sub-centres at the most peripheral \nlevel to the district hospitals at the district level. It is highly desirable that they should be fully functional and deliver \nquality care.

In the former, the \npain is associated with a specific cause such as cancer. With chronic non-malignant pain, the original tissue \ninjury present but not progressive or has been healed. Identifying an organic cause for this type of chronic pain is \nmore difficult.\nChronic pain differs, from acute pain in that it is harder for the patient to provide specific information about the \nlocation and the intensity of the pain. Over time it becomes more difficult for the patient to differentiate the exact \nlocation of the pain and identify the intensity of the pain.

It is estimated that at least 10 million Indians are in \nserious health-related suffering every year.\nThe suffering can be because of pain and other symptoms or because of social, mental or spiritual issues.  \nPalliative care addresses serious health-related suffering in all these domains. Understandably, dealing \nwith these necessitates are multidiciplinary teamwork. There is something for everyone to do, including the \npatient and family, the community around them and all participants in health care delivery.\nIf we are to prevent and treat suffering, the application of palliative care has to happen all through the course \nof the disease from the time the suffering starts, which can even be before the time of diagnosis. Wherever \ndisease-specific treatment is being given, it has to go hand-in-hand with palliative care.\nMoreover, palliative care is not only for the patient but also for the family.

What is the recommended schedule for testing Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) in pregnant women?,"To diagnose women with gestational diabetes (GDM), the recommended schedule for testing GDM is as follows:

1. **First Test**: The first test should be performed during the first antenatal contact of pregnancy. This should ideally occur early in pregnancy, such as within 24-28 weeks of pregnancy.

2. **Second Test**: If the first test is negative (i.e., not positive for GDM), a second test should be conducted at least 4 weeks after the first test. The second test can be performed either during 24-28 weeks or immediately after delivery if the first test was negative.

3. **Third Test**: In cases where the first two tests are both negative, one additional test is recommended to confirm GDM. This should ideally be done at least 1 month postpartum and should be conducted within 6 months of delivery.

4. **Fourth Test**: If the third test is positive (indicating GDM), further testing can be performed to determine if the pregnancy is due to gestational diabetes or another cause, such as hyperglycemia from other medical conditions like hypertension.

5. **Fifth Test**: In cases where the fourth test is positive for GDM and the pregnancy is confirmed to be due to gestational diabetes, a fifth test should be performed at least 6 months postpartum. This can involve testing the mother's blood sugar levels again using an automated glucose meter or by taking her blood samples.

The recommended schedule ensures that GDM is diagnosed early in pregnancy, allowing for prompt management and appropriate treatment of both the mother and the baby.","['followed up for treatment.\nUrine Test for the presence of sugar To diagnose women with gestational diabetes\nGestational diabetes (GDM) is a \ncondition of high blood glucose levels \namong women during pregnancy.

Adolescent immunization 
Under Universal Immunization Program (UIP), adolescents aged 10 years and 16 years are to be vaccinated 
with Tetanus and adult Diphtheria (Td) vaccine as per national immunization schedule (annexure). 
Different strategies are being followed in the states to optimise adolescent immunization with Td10 and 
Td16 vaccination:
1. Convergence with Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) programme to improve Td10 and Td16 
coverage mainly at schools.
2. Using VHSNDs and UHSNDs to provide Td10 and Td16 vaccination for out of school children.
3. Organize Td immunization week (s) to improve Td10 and Td16 coverage.

3. Organize Td immunization week (s) to improve Td10 and Td16 coverage.
4. School-going adolescents of class 5 and class 10 can be vaccinated using platforms like School Health 
program (SHP), RBSK as well as by carrying out Td adolescent immunization week once every year. 
Out of school adolescents can be vaccinated by strengthening the existing routine immunization 
platforms under VHSND. 
Depending on the feasibility and states’ prerogative, a combination of the strategies is also being used 
for more effective coverage outcomes.
Key Strategic Components
1. Microplanning: Comprehensive microplanning is the basis for delivery of quality immunization 
services to the community. The availability of updated and complete microplans at a planning unit 
(urban/rural) demonstrates preparedness of a unit and directly affects the quality of services provided. 
Microplans are prepared for a one-year period but must be reviewed every quarter. For Td vaccination 
two types of microplans need to be prepared: (a) for School going and (b) for out of school adolescents. 
Specific components of a RI micro plan for Td immunization include:
 ● Enlisting of all villages/wards/tolas/HRAs
 ● Estimation of the target population:

What is the 'Nishchay' kit used for in the context of maternal health?,"In the context provided, the ""Nishchay"" kit (also known as the Nishchay Kit) is specifically mentioned to be used during pregnancy. The kit's purpose is outlined as follows:

1. **Purpose**: To provide a kit for early detection of pregnancy.
2. **Availability**: It should be available with the woman at her first trimester of pregnancy.

The context also mentions that the Nishchay kit is provided by ASHA (Community Health Service Association), and it's used to detect pregnancy in women during their pregnancies. The use of this kit is described as being ""regularly collected from sub-centers"" and given to women for early detection of pregnancy. This suggests that the Nishchay kit plays a crucial role in helping pregnant women receive timely prenatal care.

The context also notes that ASHA will supervise all work done by her team of ANM (ANMs) during this process, which includes collecting the Nishchay kits and providing them to women for early detection of pregnancy. This indicates that ASHA is responsible for ensuring the proper distribution and use of these kits during the pregnancy period.

Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs):
Across the country in the past two 
decades, people have experienced 
a dramatic change in the pattern 
of diseases. There is a declining 
trend in infectious (communicable) 
diseases and a steady rise in the 
so-called lifestyle diseases or non-
communicable diseases. 
Diet and lifestyle are two major factors 
thought to influence susceptibility 
to many diseases. Drug abuse, 
tobacco use, smoking and alcohol 
consumption, as well as lack of exercise 
may increase the risk of developing 
certain diseases in later part of life.  
There is greater rate of obesity due 
to sedentary lifestyles, more time on 
computers/phones and increased 
intake of high energy sugary and fried 
foods and drinks. In the age group 15-
19 years nearly 2 per 1000 girls and 1 per 1000 boys suffer from diabetes (NFHS-3).
Adolescence provides an opportune time for positive behaviour modification, to mitigate the emergence 
of risk factors of NCDs. The main preventable risk factors for NCDs such as tobacco and alcohol 
consumption, poor dietary habits, sedentary lifestyle, and stress have their beginnings often in this age 
group. So, it is imperative to initiate the promotion of healthy lifestyle habits at a younger age to prevent 
NCDs.

consumption, poor dietary habits, sedentary lifestyle, and stress have their beginnings often in this age 
group. So, it is imperative to initiate the promotion of healthy lifestyle habits at a younger age to prevent 
NCDs. 
Nutrition during adolescence 
Adolescence is a significant period for physical growth and sexual maturation. Nutrition being an 
important determinant of physical and mental growth of adolescents as an important area that needs 
attention. 
Inadequate nutritional intake during adolescence can have serious consequences throughout the 
reproductive years and beyond. Poor nutrition during adolescence can impair the work capacity and 
productivity of adolescent boys and girls in their later years. Further, an undernourished girl is at the risk 
of developing complications during pregnancy and the chances of her giving birth to a low-birth-weight 
baby increases, thus perpetuating a vicious cycle of malnutrition and ill-health, and an intergenerational 
effect. 
About half of the adolescent girls (15-19 years) suffer from anemia (NFHS-4). 42% of adolecent girls and 
45% of adolescent boys of the same age group are reported to have Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5 
(NFHS-4). Iodine Deficiency Disorders can lead to growth retardation, delayed puberty and menarche, 
juvenile hypothyroidism etc. Missing meals, eating junk food and food fads are equal in rural and urban

(NFHS-4). Iodine Deficiency Disorders can lead to growth retardation, delayed puberty and menarche, 
juvenile hypothyroidism etc. Missing meals, eating junk food and food fads are equal in rural and urban 
areas among adolescents, affecting their health adversely. This is driven by fancy towards role models 
and publicity from the food industry. 
Balanced Diet 
A balanced diet is one that provides all nutrients in required quantity and proportions for maintaining 
health and general well-being and makes a small provision for extra nutrients to withstand short duration 
of illness. It can be achieved through a blend of the basic food groups namely carbohydrates, proteins, 
fats, vitamins, and minerals. As these are present in different types of food items like pulses, cereals and 
millets, green vegetables and milk, egg, fish, meat etc., it is important to eat these food items in the right 
mix every day.",78.2473087310791,2732.168436050415,10,FAISS (Dense)
What are the '4 A's' of First Aid?,"Based solely on the provided context, here is a summary of the key points related to first aid:

1. **First aid is essential for medical treatment**.
2. **First aid is crucial in saving life and preventing worsening conditions or promoting recovery**.
3. **There are numerous circumstances which may require first aid**, including unexpected illnesses or injuries.

The context does not provide specific details about the types of emergencies that might necessitate first aid, but it mentions that there are various scenarios where first aid can be applied, such as falls at home, equipment-related accidents, and road traffic incidents. The training materials suggest that first aid is a valuable skill for healthcare workers to have.

The context does not provide information about the specific protocols or guidelines for managing common emergencies like burns and trauma at primary care levels. However, it does mention that these services are expected at community level and include general measures such as scene safety, early identification of patients, triaging methods, and ensuring patient safety during transport.

In summary, while the context doesn't provide detailed information about specific emergency protocols or guidelines, it emphasizes the importance of first aid in medical treatment and highlights the need for comprehensive training to ensure that healthcare workers are prepared to handle various emergencies.","['237\nFirst Aid before Referral\nCHAPTER 14\nFIRST AID BEFORE REFERRAL\nObjectives\n•\t First aid is the most important aspect of medical treatment.\n•\t First aid is the assistance given to a person experiencing an unexpected illness or injury to \nsave life, prevent the condition from worsening or to promote recovery.\n•\t There are numerous circumstances which may require first aid, and numerous nations have \nlegislation, regulation, or guidance which specifies a basic level of first aid provision in \nspecific conditions.\n•\t First aid, in any case, does not basically require any specific equipment or past data, and \nmay include improvisation with materials offered at the time.\nVital Signs\nVital Signs Good Poor\nHeart Rate 60-100 beats per minute Less than 60 or greater than 100 beats per minute\nRespirations 14-16 breaths per minute Less than 14 breaths per minute\nSkin Warm, pink and dry Cool, pale and moist\nConsciousness Alert and orientated Drowsy or unconscious\nFour A’s of First Aid\nAwareness Assessment Action After care\nObserve\nStop to Help\nAssess what is required to be \ndone.\nAsk yourself, ‘Can I do it?’\nDo what you can.\nCall for expert medical help.\nTake care of your and the by \nstander’s safety.\nOnce you have assisted the \nvictim, stay with him/her till \nexpert care arrives.\nWhile Delivering First Aid Always Remember\n•\t Prevent deterioration.\n•\t Act swiftly, deliberately and confidently.\n•\t Golden Hour – First 60 minutes following an accident.', '31Operational Guidelines for Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma at Primary Care Level\ndisasters.

What are the symptoms of Presbyopia in the elderly?,"Based solely on the provided context, there is no specific information about Presbyopia symptoms in the elderly. The passage does not mention any particular age group or individual experiencing presbyopia. Presbyopia affects vision with age and can occur at various stages of life, but it is not mentioned as a common issue affecting an entire elderly population.

To provide a more comprehensive answer:

Presbyopia is a condition where the eye's ability to focus on nearby objects improves gradually over time. It typically begins in middle adulthood (around 40 years old) and can affect all age groups, though it tends to be more prevalent among older adults. The symptoms of presbyopia include difficulty seeing distant objects clearly, often leading to blurriness or a need for reading glasses.

However, the passage does not provide specific details about how presbyopia affects an elderly population. Presbyopia is generally considered mild and can affect individuals in their 60s and older without requiring immediate medical intervention. If you're looking for information on presbyopia symptoms in the elderly, it would be best to consult a healthcare provider or relevant health resources specific to this age group.

If you have any other questions about Presbyopia or need more detailed information, please feel free to ask!","['163\nCommon Ophthalmic, ENT and Oral Health Issues\nThere is initially not much complaint of distant vision as that can be corrected by exerting \naccommodation.

The result of refractive errors is blurred vision, which is \nsometimes so severe that it causes visual impairment.\nFour most common refractive errors are:\n•\t Myopia (nearsightedness): difficulty in seeing distant objects clearly\n•\t Hypermetropia (farsightedness): difficulty in seeing close objects clearly\n•\t Astigmatism: distorted vision resulting from an irregularly curved cornea\n•\t Presbyopia: which leads to difficulty in reading or seeing at arm’s length, it is linked to \nageing and occurs almost universally with increasing age. \nSymptoms and Signs\nMyopia\n1. Congenital (may be associated with convergent squint)\n2. Simple or developmental (most common)\n3. Pathological, degenerative or progressive (most rapidly progressing) \nThere is reduced visual acuity for distance but near objects can be seen clearly. Usually there \nis no headache. Person may squint his/her eyes to see at a distance. In pathological myopia  \nperson may complain of seeing black floaters in front of eyes. \nHypermetropia \n1. Congenital (rare)\n2.
